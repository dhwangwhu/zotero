SUMMARY
Large noncoding RNAs are emerging as an important component in cellular regulation. Considerable evidence indicates that these transcripts act directly as functional RNAs rather than through an encoded protein product. However, a recent study of ribosome occupancy reported that many large intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) are bound by ribosomes, raising the possibility that they are translated into proteins. Here, we show that classical noncoding RNAs and 50 UTRs show the same ribosome occupancy as lincRNAs, demonstrating that ribosome occupancy alone is not sufﬁcient to classify transcripts as coding or noncoding. Instead, we deﬁne a metric based on the known property of translation whereby translating ribosomes are released upon encountering a bona ﬁde stop codon. We show that this metric accurately discriminates between protein-coding transcripts and all classes of known noncoding transcripts, including lincRNAs. Taken together, these results argue that the large majority of lincRNAs do not function through encoded proteins.
INTRODUCTION
The mammalian genome encodes many thousands of genes thought to encode large noncoding RNAs (Birney et al., 2007; Carninci et al., 2005; Derrien et al., 2012), including $3,500 termed ‘‘large intergenic noncoding RNAs’’ (lincRNAs) (Guttman et al., 2009, 2010). The lincRNAs have recently been shown to play key roles in diverse biological processes and are emerging as an important class of regulatory molecules (Guttman et al., 2011; Guttman and Rinn, 2012; Ørom et al., 2010; Ulitsky et al., 2011; Wang and Chang, 2011). The lincRNAs resemble

messenger RNAs (mRNAs) with respect to transcription, length, and splicing structure yet differ in that (1) they do not contain open reading frames (ORFs) that show the cross-species mutational pattern expected of evolutionarily conserved proteins (Guttman et al., 2009, 2010); (2) they do not contain ORFs that show the within-species substitution patterns expected of recently evolved proteins (Figure S1 available online; Experimental Procedures); (3) they tend to be highly enriched in the nucleus (Derrien et al., 2012); (4) many physically interact with chromatin regulatory proteins to affect gene expression (Guttman et al., 2011; Guttman and Rinn, 2012; Wang and Chang, 2011); and (5) they rarely produce proteins detectable by mass spectrometry (Ba´ nfai et al., 2012; Slavoff et al., 2013). Together, these results suggest that lincRNAs function directly as RNA molecules rather than through a translated protein product.
Recently, an approach termed ribosome proﬁling was described that enables the global analysis of translation in a wide range of organisms, including yeast and mammals. This method involves digestion of RNA followed by separation of 80S ribosomes based on their size and density through a sucrose cushion (Ingolia et al., 2009, 2011). The associated RNAs are then sequenced to assess the occupancy of ribosomes on RNAs. Ribosome proﬁling can be used to identify mRNAs associated with 80S ribosomes, distinguish ribosomefree 30 UTRs on these messages, and assess the quantitative dynamics of translation within translated regions (Ingolia et al., 2009, 2011). Global identiﬁcation of the locations of 80S ribosomes can be used to identify previously unknown translation events. Deﬁning the full set of translation products is important for identifying regions that encode functional proteins (SternGinossar et al., 2012). Yet not all translation events lead to stable, functional polypeptides. Instead, this translation could be important for regulation of a downstream ORF (Geballe and Morris, 1994), contribute to the antigenic potential of pathogens (Starck et al., 2008), regulate mRNA stability by inducing nonsensemediated decay (Smith and Steitz, 1998), and may even serve as a source of proto-proteins enabling the evolution of novel

proteins (Carvunis et al., 2012). Finally, some events may have no biological function at all, representing biological noise without deleterious consequence to the organism. Thus, the detection of 80S ribosomes on an RNA does not alone provide evidence that the RNA encodes a functional protein. For example, the host messages for a number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are translated, and this is used to induce rapid degradation through the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, thereby allowing disposal of the mature RNA after the snoRNAs have been extracted from intronic regions (Smith and Steitz, 1998). Thus, it is important to develop strategies for using the 80S footprint data provided by ribosome proﬁling experiments to distinguish true messengers that encode functional proteins from those that are noncoding.
Recently, it was reported that the ribosome occupancy of most lincRNAs more closely resembles translated regions of protein-coding genes compared to 30 UTRs, raising the possibility that lincRNAs are translated into functional proteins (Ingolia et al., 2011). Given the many lines of evidence that lincRNAs do not encode functional proteins, we examined the ribosome proﬁling data in greater detail. In particular, we considered whether noncoding RNAs should be expected to resemble 30 UTRs with respect to their ribosome proﬁles. There is an important distinction between these two situations. When a ribosome engaged in translating an ORF encounters a stop codon, it is actively disassembled and is recycled (Jackson et al., 2010; Kisselev and Buckingham, 2000) (Figure 1A); this creates a sharp drop in the ribosome occupancy in 30 UTRs relative to the ORF. In contrast, in transcripts that have not been selected to produce a distinct protein product, it is possible that the ribosome initiates translation at multiple locations and thus may show signiﬁcant occupancy across regions within the transcript or even over the entire transcript. (In theory, ribosomes might also scan the transcript without engaging in translation; we will address this possibility elsewhere.) Thus, noncoding transcripts might show very different ribosome proﬁles than 30 UTRs.
Here, we study the pattern of ribosome occupancy on transcripts to evaluate whether lincRNAs show evidence of encoding functional proteins. In particular, we analyze the existing ribosome proﬁling data across other noncoding regions, including 50 UTRs and classical noncoding RNAs (such as small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs, microRNA precursors, and large ncRNAs such as telomerase RNA and RNase P), all of which are well established to be noncoding (Eddy, 2001). We ﬁnd that known noncoding controls also show ribosome proﬁles that differ from those of the 30 UTRs of protein-coding genes. Moreover, 50 UTRs resemble coding regions of protein-coding genes more closely than do lincRNAs.
To systematically analyze the pattern of ribosome occupancy across different classes of RNAs, we developed a metric that we term the ribosome release score (RRS), which identiﬁes functional protein-coding transcripts with greater sensitivity by detecting the termination of translation at the end of an ORF (Jackson et al., 2010; Kisselev and Buckingham, 2000). We show that the RRS sharply distinguishes between the class of well-established protein-coding regions and other classes such as 50 UTRs and classical ncRNAs and that the class of lincRNAs closely resembles the other noncoding classes with

respect to this metric. Because 50 UTRs and classical ncRNAs do not encode functional proteins, the similar pattern of ribosome occupancy on the lincRNAs indicates that they too are unlikely, as a class, to produce functional proteins.
RESULTS
We began by deﬁning a variety of control sets whose coding status is well accepted: (1) the translated regions, 50 UTRs, and 30 UTRs of 10,050 known protein-coding transcripts (‘‘genes encoding typical-size proteins’’); (2) the translated regions of 639 known protein-coding transcripts encoding a protein with <100 amino acids (‘‘genes encoding small proteins’’); and (3) 130 well-established noncoding RNAs that are well expressed in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (referred to as ‘‘classical noncoding RNAs’’), including small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, microRNA precursors, and large noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as telomerase RNA, RNase P, Neat1, and Neat2/Malat1 (see Experimental Procedures).
Relative to these control sets, we analyzed a set of 167 expressed lincRNAs whose RNA levels were well represented in the Ingolia et al. (2011) data set (see Experimental Procedures). We previously deﬁned these lincRNA transcripts based on a chromatin signature of active transcription (Guttman et al., 2009). This lincRNA set excludes a small group of 11 genes that have short ORFs that show a pattern of evolutionary conservation characteristic of protein-coding genes (Guttman et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2011) and thus may encode a small protein; we refer to this set as the codon substitution frequency (CSF)+ set (see Experimental Procedures). In addition, this lincRNA set excludes a small group of seven genes that have nonconserved long ORFs but have been annotated as putative protein-coding genes based on homology to other proteins (see Experimental Procedures).
We analyzed the previously published ribosome proﬁling data in mouse ES cells (Ingolia et al., 2011) for each class of RNAs. We note that the absolute level of ribosome occupancy (as assayed by the ribosome proﬁling method) is not a useful metric because it is strongly correlated with RNA levels for both coding and noncoding transcripts (r = 0.89). To overcome this problem, a relative metric was proposed called the translational efﬁciency (TE) (Ingolia et al., 2011). For each gene, this relative metric is deﬁned as the number of sequencing reads observed among ribosome-associated RNA divided by the number of reads in total poly-A+ RNA. The TE score can be computed as either (1) the average value (TE mean) across an entire feature (transcript or region) or (2) the maximum value (TE max) in windows of a speciﬁed size within a feature. Ingolia et al. (2011) based their conclusions on the TEmax metric with a window size of 90 bases in order to account for potential translation in short coding regions within a longer noncoding transcript. Accordingly, we used the same metric.
We ﬁrst conﬁrmed the previous observations that (1) coding regions differ sharply from 30 UTRs (Figures 1B–1D) and (2) the lincRNAs resemble coding regions more closely than 30 UTRs (Figures 1C, 1D, and 2A). It was these observations that raised the possibility that most lincRNAs are translated into proteins.
Interestingly, we found that the same observations applied to the noncoding controls—that is, the classical noncoding RNAs and 50 UTRs. As with the lincRNAs, these noncoding

controls also more closely resemble protein-coding regions than 30 UTRs with respect to either the TE-mean (Figure 1C) or the TE-
max metric (Figures 1D and 2A). Indeed, $48% of these non-

translated controls have translational efﬁciency scores that exceed the 95th percentile of the scores for 30 UTRs (Figures
1C and 1D).

50 UTRs One possible explanation for the high TE scores for 50 UTRs is that it results solely from the translation of a small number of upstream ORFs (uORFs). To explore this possibility, we ﬁrst excluded regions within the 50 UTR that contained ORFs beginning with a canonical start codon (AUG). After removing these uORFs, we still observed a striking difference between 50 UTRs and 30 UTRs using both the TE mean and TE max (Figure S1). We further excluded the regions surrounding all ORFs beginning with a near-cognate start codon (CUG, GUG, or UUG), which, together with canonical ORFs, account for roughly 75% of proposed uORFs (Fritsch et al., 2012; Ingolia et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012). After removing these near-cognate uORFs, we still observed a similar difference compared to 30 UTRs (Figure S1). Although some of the observed ribosome occupancy in 50 UTRs is surely due to uORFs (a topic that we discuss elsewhere), the results indicate that the observed ribosome occupancy cannot be explained solely by sharply deﬁned uORFs with cognate or near-cognate start codons.
Classical ncRNAs We considered the possibility that the ribosome occupancy measure may be inﬂated for the classical ncRNAs because many lack polyA tails. This is potentially relevant because the ‘‘translational efﬁciency’’ deﬁned by Ingolia et al. (2011) is based on normalization to polyA-selected mRNA levels, whereas the ‘‘ribosome-associated fraction’’ involved no polyA selection (Ingolia et al., 2011). To control for polyA status, we generated a control RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) expression data set that was not polyA selected (see Experimental Procedures). Importantly, when normalizing by the non-polyA-selected RNA levels, we observe a nearly identical result, with the lincRNAs closely resembling the classical ncRNAs, and both being well separated from the 30 UTRs (Figure S2). Although this consideration affects abundance estimates for certain nonadenylated RNAs, the high observed ribosome occupancy is not simply due to the lack of poly-A tails on the classical ncRNAs.
Notably, some of the strongest translational efﬁciency scores (>99th percentile of 30 UTRs in both polyA and non-polyA normalized samples) are observed for very well-characterized ncRNAs, including the telomerase RNA, RNase P, small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, vault RNA, microRNAs (miRNAs), and other RNAs that have been clearly demonstrated to function as RNA molecules (Bartel, 2004; Eddy, 2001; Shippen-Lentz and Blackburn, 1990; Stark et al., 1978) (Figures 2 and S2). This observation raised the possibility that some background RNA fragments, not protected by a translating 80S ribosome, contribute to the apparent translation of these noncoding RNAs. Indeed, such background could arise in transcripts that are highly structured and embedded in ribonucleoprotein complexes. A strategy for identifying true 80S ribosome footprints will be presented elsewhere.
Yet, even after removing likely non-80S ribosomal background reads, the translational efﬁciency score still does not distinguish between protein-coding genes and the noncoding controls (Figure S2). Accordingly, the ‘‘translational efﬁciency’’ score per se does not reliably indicate whether a class of transcripts—such as lincRNAs—is translated into functional proteins. The fact

that the TE-max metric is not signiﬁcantly better at separating these classes than the TE mean implies that the observed results are not due to small patches within these regions.
Ribosome Release Separates Classes of Coding and Noncoding RNAs Because the translational efﬁciency score does not distinguish between the classes of coding and noncoding RNAs, we explored whether we could develop a metric that does distinguish between these classes.
We ﬁrst attempted to deﬁne a metric based on translational start sites. Speciﬁcally, we used ribosome proﬁling data generated after treatment with harringtonine, a drug that binds 60S ribosomes and has been reported to block initiation (Ingolia et al., 2011). As such data are expected to show enrichment at sites of translation initiation, we tested whether we could distinguish between the annotated start codons in protein-coding genes and randomly chosen start codons in classical noncoding RNAs. We observed little difference in enrichment in the former set relative to the latter set. This was true regardless of whether we studied the maximum enrichment seen over any start codon or the enrichment seen at the start codon of the ORF with the highest ribosome occupancy (see Extended Experimental Procedures and Figure S2). Because enrichment in the presence of harringtonine in this data set did not distinguish between known protein-coding RNAs and classical noncoding RNAs, we could not use these data to study the translational status of lincRNAs.
We next attempted to deﬁne a metric based on translational stop sites. Because translating ribosomes are known to be released upon encountering a stop codon (Jackson et al., 2010; Kisselev and Buckingham, 2000), we reasoned that translation of a discrete (nonoverlapping) ORF should be associated with a sharp decrease in ribosome occupancy between a protein-coding region and the subsequent 30 UTR. Indeed, such a striking pattern occurs in known protein-coding transcripts (Ingolia et al., 2011). We thus searched for such a decrease in the other classes of noncoding transcripts (see Figures 1B and 2C). To do this, we deﬁned putative coding regions within a transcript as all regions contained within an ORF—that is, a region in any reading frame that begins with a start codon and ends with the next inframe stop codon. We deﬁned the corresponding putative 30 UTRs as a region beginning immediately downstream of the ORF and ending at the ﬁrst subsequent start codon (in any reading frame); we truncated the putative 30 UTR at the ﬁrst subsequent start codon to allow for the possibility of polycistronic transcripts.
We deﬁned the RRS to be the ratio between the total number of reads that are contained within the putative coding region and the total number of reads contained within the putative 30 UTR, normalized by the respective lengths of these regions. We then normalized by the ratio of reads in the mRNA coverage between the two regions, which has the effect of correcting for any erroneous annotations of the 30 UTRs (see Experimental Procedures).
We found that the RRS does an excellent job of distinguishing between the class of known protein-coding genes and the class of noncoding control transcripts (Figure 3A). The median RRS for the protein-coding genes is $112, meaning that ribosome occupancy is $112-fold higher in the coding region preceding the stop codon compared to the region immediately after the stop

codon (Figure 3A). By contrast, the RRS across all ORFs within the classical ncRNAs, 50 UTRs, and 30 UTRs has a median of 0.81, reﬂecting roughly equal coverage before and after the stop codon (Figure 3A).
We then examined the RRS for lincRNAs. Importantly, the median RRS for lincRNA ORFs is $1, which is similar to the other noncoding regions and very different than for protein-coding regions (Figures 3A and 4A–4E).
To account for the possibility that there may be a single ORF buried within a long noncoding transcript, we repeated the analysis by analyzing only the ORF with the highest ribosome occupancy (as deﬁned by the TE score). We still observed a striking difference ($51-fold) between the class of proteincoding regions (median RRS $112) and both the classical ncRNAs and lincRNAs sets (median RRS 2.24 and 2.09, respectively) (Figure 3B).
In addition, even when looking only at the ORF with the highest RRS (RRS max), we still observe a dramatic separation between protein-coding RNAs and the noncoding RNAs, with an $36-fold separation between the medians of coding regions and lincRNAs (Figure 3C). Notably, this separation is larger than the 24-fold separation observed between the medians of coding regions and 30 UTRs using the TE-max metric (see Figure 1D).
Importantly, we note that the ability of the RRS metric to separate the classes of protein-coding regions and noncoding RNAs is robust to the precise implementation of the metric. For example, the RRS described above counts all reads overlapping the putative coding region. This provides a robust estimate of the ribosome occupancy and allows for the detection of tiny coding regions, including those that are smaller than the fragments ($30 nt) generated in the ribosome proﬁling assay. Indeed, the only limitation for detection using this approach is the size of the 30 UTR, which would have to be larger than the fragment length generated in the ribosome proﬁling assay. A more conservative approach would include only reads that are fully contained within the putative coding region, which increases conﬁdence in the assignment of the ribosome reads but would prevent detection of tiny coding regions. Using this alternative implementation, we obtain similar separations between the classes of known protein-coding regions and all noncoding RNAs (Figure S3). Similarly, the RRS described above used a trimmed 30 UTR to account for possible polycistronic transcripts. If we alternatively deﬁne the putative 30 UTR as the entire region following a stop codon, we observe similar separations (Figure S4).
Although the RRS metric does an excellent job of distinguishing between the class of protein-coding genes and the class of noncoding RNAs, it does not provide a perfect classiﬁer for individual transcripts within these sets because there is overlap between the distributions for coding and classical noncoding transcripts (Figure 3A). The known protein-coding transcripts with low RRS are primarily for transcripts with short 30 UTRs (less than the fragment length), where estimation of the 30 UTR counts are less reliable. Other cases occur when the 30 UTRs have higher read coverage possibly due to ribosome readthrough, overlapping translation of antisense transcription, or nonribosomal contamination. As such, conclusions about coding potential of any individual transcript based on the RRS alone should be taken with care.

Importantly, the RRS is intended as a relative metric to compare different classes of transcripts. As such, the absolute level of the RRS may not be informative because it will be impacted by various features of a particular data set. Similarly, the RRS is not intended to measure the relative proportion of heterogeneous translation states, where some proportion of a given transcript may be translated and the remainder nontranslated; rather, it is meant to provide predominant translational features of a class of transcripts (e.g., mRNAs are predominately protein coding, and lincRNAs are predominantly noncoding). Furthermore, the RRS is not designed to identify speciﬁc translated regions within a transcript containing multiple overlapping or nearby translated regions. (We note that overlapping translation can act as a regulatory mechanism [Lu et al., 2004] or even produce alternative functional proteins [e.g., Ink/ARF (Sharpless and DePinho, 1999)].)
Taken together, the RRS shows strikingly different properties than the TE score. The TE score distinguishes the class of 30 UTRs from all other RNA classes, whereas the RRS score distinguishes protein-coding regions from all other RNA classes. The TE score indicates that lincRNAs are bound by ribosomes to the same extent as 50 UTRs or classical ncRNAs, whereas the RRS indicates that lincRNAs, like 30 UTRs, 50 UTRs. and classical ncRNAs, rarely show the known signatures of translational termination that are characteristic of protein-coding regions.
Examination of Speciﬁc Cases To further study the utility of the RRS, we revisited the previously published lincRNA collections (Guttman et al., 2010, 2011). In seven cases, transcripts that contain long ORFs (>100 amino acids) but lacked any conservation of their ORFs had been subsequently reannotated as putative protein-coding genes based on their homology to other proteins (Pruitt et al., 2012). (These include four RNAs associated with pluripotency [Guttman et al., 2011].) Because these transcripts had been removed from our lincRNA collections, they provided useful test cases for the RRS method. Although the translational efﬁciency scores for these seven transcripts resemble those for lincRNAs and coding regions, the RRS scores clearly distinguish the seven transcripts from lincRNAs and match those for coding regions; this provides independent evidence that these seven transcripts are likely to be translated. (We note that our lincRNA catalog contains a handful of additional transcripts that contain long ORFs, such as the Xist ncRNA, but show no evidence of coding potential based on evolutionary conservation or homology to known proteins; these cases have low RRS.)
In addition to these 7 transcripts, 12 additional lincRNAs showed high RRS but low CSF. These 12 transcripts also fail to show other detectable signatures of translation such as protein homology; they may also represent noise within the RRS distribution, as a comparable proportion of the classical ncRNA transcripts would be similarly mischaracterized based on the RRS at this threshold (Figure 3A). This is consistent with the observation above that RRS is not a perfect classiﬁer for individual transcripts. In contrast, methods such as CSF demonstrate sharper discriminative power between coding and noncoding transcripts (Guttman et al., 2009,

handful of cases previously noted as likely

to encode proteins (Guttman et al., 2009, [0 – 50] 2010). Notably, the genes in the CSF+

set have higher RRS scores (comparable

from the numerous transcripts likely to function directly as RNAs.
DISCUSSION
The observation that lincRNAs have higher ribosome occupancy than 30 UTRs raised questions about the biological function of lincRNAs. Here, we show that a more complete analysis of the ribosome proﬁling data argues that most do not function by encoding small proteins. First, the ribosome occupancy observed on lincRNAs is comparable to that seen on other known noncoding RNAs; this implies that ribosome occupancy per se is not a reliable indicator of whether a transcript functions by encoding a protein. Second, the ribosomal proﬁling data indicate that most lincRNAs, like other well-known noncoding RNAs, do not show the sharp decrease in ribosome occupancy following a stop codon that is consistently seen for known protein-coding genes (including those encoding small proteins). Taken together, these ﬁndings clearly demonstrate that lincRNAs are likely to function directly as RNA molecules rather than through encoded protein products.
If 50 UTRs, lincRNAs, and other known noncoding RNAs do not act through encoded proteins, why do they exhibit any ribosome occupancy at all? There are several possible explanations.
One possibility is that the fragments obtained in the ribosome proﬁling experiments result from protection of RNA by nonribosomal RNA-protein complexes or other sources of nonribosomal contamination. Indeed, some of the observed RNA fragments likely do not represent true 80S ribosomal footprints in that there are many fragments observed from classical noncoding RNAs that are predominantly localized in the nucleus (such as telomerase RNA, RNase P, snRNAs, and others). Consistent with this notion, the fragments derived from both cytoplasmic and nuclear classical noncoding RNAs show a different size distribution than that observed for protein-coding genes. In contrast, the distributions for 50 UTRs and lincRNAs resemble the distributions observed for protein-coding genes. However, it is not possible to determine whether individual fragments arise from the ribosome based solely on size, and at least some of the reads on lincRNAs may also be nonribosomal contamination. Future work, including the afﬁnity puriﬁcation of 80S ribosomes and mass spectrometry of small peptides, will help address this topic as well as provide more accurate determination of the translational status of individual transcripts.
The RRS metric is well suited to distinguish real translation from nonribosomal contamination because it is robust to potential protection by nonribosomal proteins, as such protection should show no bias for the presence of a stop codon. Furthermore, as the RRS involves comparing putative translated regions within a transcript, it is robust to other potential sources of bias that lead to higher levels of contaminating nonribosomal reads on speciﬁc classes of RNA, such as that observed on the classical ncRNAs.
An attractive possibility is that the presence of ribosomes on some ncRNAs may reﬂect the default engagement of the translation machinery with any capped transcripts present in the cytosol. In the absence of selective pressure for the use of a speciﬁc start codon, ribosomes may initiate translation at

heterogeneous sites with a bias toward the beginning of the transcript. Additionally, ribosomes that encounter short ORFs may be capable of reinitiating translation after encountering stop codons. This may lead to the translation of multiple, overlapping reading frames, biased toward the 50 end of the transcript. Such engagement may produce 80S footprints but without the translation of a predominant functional reading frame and the sharp decrease in ribosome occupancy at its stop codon. The RRS metric is well suited to distinguish this behavior and thus provides a valuable metric to prioritize candidates for more in-depth characterization using labor-intensive approaches such as mass spectrometry and or epitope tagging that have been used to evaluate whether translation events observed in ribosome proﬁling experiments contribute to a cell’s proteome (Ba´ nfai et al., 2012; Slavoff et al., 2013; Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012).
If classical ncRNAs and lincRNAs are bound by ribosomes, even though they lack canonical features of translation, this raises fascinating questions similar to those raised by pervasive transcription, which occurs even in regions of the genome that do not produce stable RNA products (Birney et al., 2007; Carninci et al., 2005; Kapranov et al., 2007). Translation can have functional implications beyond the production of a protein product by affecting the stability, structure, and localization of an RNA. It can also reﬂect noise with no direct functional role that can be co-opted over the course of evolution in order to create a new coding sequence. More work will be needed to determine the biological implications of these diverse effects and their impact on the biogenesis and functions of noncoding RNAs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Filtering and Alignment of Sequencing Reads We downloaded the data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) using accession number GSE30839 (Ingolia et al., 2011). Fastq ﬁles were split into two sets based on whether the libraries were generated by polyA tailing or linker ligation. Samples generated by polyA tailing were directly aligned. For the remaining samples, the fastq ﬁles were ﬁltered by ﬁrst clipping all reads for the adaptor sequences using the FASTX-Toolkit version 0.013. We then aligned all reads to the genome by using Tophat version 1.4.1, including a transcriptome reference deﬁned using our ab initio transcriptome reconstruction of mouse ES cells (Guttman et al., 2010), along with all RefSeq- and UCSCdeﬁned transcripts.
We note that all analyses presented of translational efﬁciency and ribosome release use the noncycloheximide-treated ribosome proﬁling data for consistency with the previous analysis (Ingolia et al., 2011). However, we note that the results are comparable even when using cycloheximide-treated ribosome proﬁling data.
Deﬁning a Set of Classical Noncoding RNAs We deﬁned a set of classical noncoding RNAs. We ﬁrst manually curated all noncoding RNAs included in the RefSeq catalog. Speciﬁcally, we retained ncRNAs that have been well characterized as noncoding, including snRNAs, snoRNAs, miRNA precursors, snoRNA host genes, and large ncRNAs with publications demonstrating a role as an RNA (such as Neat1, Neat2/Malat1, and Gas5). We then added all small nuclear RNAs and miRNA precursors downloaded from the functional RNA database (Kin et al., 2007). Finally, we added a more extensive collection of literature-curated large ncRNAs, taken from the functional RNA database (Kin et al., 2007). We mapped all RNAs to the genome and ﬁltered those that overlapped a known protein-coding gene. We excluded all tiny RNAs < 50 nt because their short size (less than the length of a sequencing read) made it difﬁcult to estimate coverage. We

248 Cell 154, 240–251, July 3, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc.

merged these different sets and collapsed all overlapping transcripts into a single merged transcript. We excluded all translation-associated RNAs, including tRNAs and ribosomal RNAs.
Deﬁning a Set of lincRNAs We started with all chromatin-deﬁned lincRNAs with transcripts that had been reconstructed from RNA-seq data (lincRNA V3). The lincRNA set was ﬁltered for all transcripts that contained a high CSF score or overlapped a known protein-coding transcript in the latest version of RefSeq (Pruitt et al., 2012), as previously described (Guttman et al., 2009, 2010). As the data set of Ingolia et al. (2011) contains signiﬁcantly lower coverage (by $5-fold) than the data used to reconstruct the lincRNA transcripts, we sought to analyze only transcripts with adequate coverage. Accordingly, we calculated the expression levels of each lincRNA from the data set of Ingolia et al. (2011) and only those lincRNAs with signiﬁcant expression relative to the randomized genomic average (p < 0.01). This yielded a set of 167 lincRNAs.
Deﬁning ORFs Using the orientation of each transcript, we deﬁned all three possible frames and identiﬁed all possible start codons. For each start codon, we then searched for an in-frame stop codon. All regions deﬁned by a start and stop codon pair were deﬁned as a putative ORF.
Excluding Upstream ORFs To exclude the possibility that the high ribosome occupancy observed in 50 UTRs was due to the presence of upstream ORFs, we deﬁned all ORFs based on the presence of an AUG followed by an in-frame stop codon within the 50 UTR regions. We then created a modiﬁed transcript that contained all regions except the putative ORFs and calculated the translational efﬁciency for the remaining regions. To exclude all possible near-cognate ORFs, we deﬁned ORFs based on the presence of an AUG, CUG, GUG, or UUG start codon followed by an in-frame stop codon. We then computed translational efﬁciency over the remaining regions.
Deﬁning a CSF+ Set of Transcripts Using the 167 lincRNA genes, we computed all possible ORFs and calculated the CSF score for each ORF using the PhyloCSF package (Lin et al., 2011). We utilized a PhyloCSF cutoff of 50 to generate a CSFÀ set (CSF < 50) and a CSF+ set (CSF > 50). We have previously shown that a CSF cutoff of 50 accurately separates known protein-coding genes from known noncoding sequences (Guttman et al., 2010). Using this cutoff, we identiﬁed 11 chromatin-deﬁned genes that exceed this cutoff (CSF+); based on their evolutionary conservation pattern, these genes are likely to encode proteins.
Computing Translational Efﬁciency Score We computed the TE score by counting the number of reads overlapping a feature in the ribosome fraction and dividing by the number of reads in the total RNA sample. For each feature, we counted only reads that were fully contained within the feature (thus avoiding counting reads that overlap multiple features). As the TE score is not a reliable estimator at low expression levels, we computed a TE score only for those features that had signiﬁcant mRNA expression above a randomized genomic background (p < 0.01). We placed no restrictions on the signiﬁcance level for the ribosome coverage.
Deﬁning the Maximum TE Score We scanned a window of 90 nt across each transcript, with windows starting and ending fully within the transcript or feature. We then calculated the TE score, excluding windows with insufﬁcient mRNA expression. We counted only reads that were fully contained in each window. To account for the difference in coverage level between ribosome and mRNA experiments, we normalized the score by dividing by the median TE max of coding genes. For consistency with the methods utilized previously by Ingolia et al. (2011), we also computed the TE max by identifying the 90-mer window with the largest number of positions covered by a ribosome read. In this case, ribosome reads were assigned to a nucleotide position as previously described (Ingolia et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, we assigned reads to positions from the 50 end of the fragment based on the following rules. For reads between (1) 29 and

30 nucleotides in length, we assigned the 15th position, (2) for reads 31–33 nucleotides in length, we assigned the 16th position, and (3) for reads between 34 and 35 nucleotides, we assigned the 17th position. We excluded all reads with a size < 29 nucleotides and > 35 nucleotides from all calculations because these are thought to represent nonribosomal contamination. If multiple windows contained the same number of covered positions, we chose the 50-most window from the transcript start site as the maximum window as previously described. We then computed the TE score for this deﬁned window across all features. We identiﬁed comparable separations across classes using both of these measures (Figure S2).
Computing ORFs with the Highest Ribosome Occupancy We deﬁned putative ORFs to be any region starting with an AUG start codon and ending with an in-frame stop codon. We computed the TE score for each ORF in the feature and retained the ORF with the highest TE score as the ORF containing the highest ribosome occupancy. We similarly deﬁned all non-ORFs as regions that occurred between a stop codon and the next start codon (in any frame). To score the TE max and TE mean for ORF and non-ORF regions, we deﬁned all ORF and non-ORFs within a transcript. We then computed the TE max or TE mean using only the regions contained within any of the ORF or non-ORF regions, respectively.
Generating a Non-PolyA-Selected RNA-Seq Data Set To generate a control mRNA data set that was not limited to transcripts that were polyadenylated, we generated a non-polyA-selected RNA-seq data set using ribosomal depletion. We isolated RNA from wild-type mouse ES cells. RNA was fragmented using 13 fragmentation buffer (Ambion AM8740) by heating at 70C for 15 min. RNA was then dephosphorylated using alkaline phosphatase (Thermo EF0651). RNA was ligated using the partial Illumina adaptor sequence with a 50-phosphate and 30-dideoxyC (AGATCGGAA GAGCGTCGTGTA) using T4 RNA ligase 1 (NEB M0204). Ribosomal RNA was depleted using 120-mer biotinylated probes complementary to the 28S, 18S, and 5.8S ribosomal RNA sequences. The hybrids were captured with streptavidin magnetic beads (Invitrogen 650-01) and removed. The remaining RNA was reverse transcribed using a primer complimentary to the linker (TACACGACGCTCTTCCGAT) using AfﬁnityScript RT (Agilent 200436) at 55C for 45 min. The complementary DNA (cDNA) was ligated with a second partial Illumina adaptor sequence with a 50-phosphate and 30-dideoxyC (AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT) using T4 RNA ligase 1. A library was then generated using PCR-containing primers with the entire Illumina adaptor sequences using Phusion polymerase (NEB M0531) for 14 cycles. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq using 44 base single-end reads.
Scoring Putative Start Codons Using Harringtonine Data The four harringtonine data sets representing varying treatment times (90 s, 120 s, 150 s, and 180 s) were analyzed separately. We deﬁned the enrichment over a start codon as follows. First, we deﬁned a start codon using the site of the AUG start codon. We then took all reads overlapping the start codon and deﬁned a ‘‘peak’’ as the total genomic span covered by reads overlapping the start codon. We then counted all reads within the peak and divided by the length of the peak. This score was then divided by the total number of reads over the transcript divided by the length of the transcript. This score was taken as the enrichment of harringtonine values over a start codon compared to the rest of the transcript. For each known coding region, we used the annotated start codon to compute the enrichment of harringtonine overlapping the start codon. For noncoding transcripts, we deﬁned putative ORFs and used the AUG site of each putative ORF as the putative start codon for analysis. We calculated the harringtonine enrichment for noncoding transcript either by using the putative ORF with the highest TE score or the ORF with the highest harringtonine enrichment.
Deﬁning the Ribosome Release Score For each ORF, we computed the number of ribosome reads fully contained in the ORF divided by the number of ribosome reads fully contained in the 30 UTR, normalizing each count by the length of the respective region to deﬁne a preliminary estimate of ribosome release strength. To account for drops in

Cell 154, 240–251, July 3, 2013 ª2013 Elsevier Inc. 249

ribosome coverage due to misannotated features or alternative termination

rather than a true stop codon, we also compute the same ratio on RNA reads.

The RNA ratio would be expected to show a similar drop in coverage under

these circumstances, but not for real stop codons. The RRS is deﬁned as

the ratio of the two normalized ratios (ultimately eliminating the need to

normalize by region length):



RRS =

mRNA

As this score is normalized within a transcript, it accounts for differences in expression levels of the transcript itself.
For known protein-coding genes, we used the annotated coding regions and 30 UTRs to calculate the RRS. For noncoding transcripts, we computed the RRS by ﬁrst deﬁning all possible ORFs. For each putative ORF, we deﬁned the 30 UTR as the region between the stop codon and the next possible start codon (in any frame). The RRS score was deﬁned only for ORFs with a significant expression level above randomized genomic background (p < 0.01). The RRS was not deﬁned for an ORF if there were no fully contained reads in the ribosome fractions overlapping both the ORF and its 30 UTR. Because of this, we also excluded all ORFs and 30 UTRs whose length was less than the size of the sequencing read length. Finally, the RRS was not deﬁned for noncoding transcripts (such as telomerase RNA) that contain no ORFs. This led to 89 lincRNAs and 79 classical ncRNAs for which the RRS was deﬁned.
Although the RRS described above increases conﬁdence that the ribosome reads originate from the coding region, it prevents detection of tiny coding regions, which are smaller than the read length used in the ribosome proﬁling assay. Although, in theory, this is more conservative because it will miss tiny ORFs, it is possible that these ORFs are the actual translated coding regions, and therefore the RRS is quite low. Because of these limitations, we also implemented an alternative version that did not require that the ribosome reads be fully contained within the ORF. In this case, we reasoned that any read overlapping the coding region would arise from a ribosome overlapping the coding region, and we counted these as ribosome reads in the coding region. We similarly computed the 30 UTR scores as any read overlapping the 30 UTR (excluding reads that also overlap the coding region that will artiﬁcially inﬂate its estimate). Using this RRS measure, we observed comparable separations between coding and all noncoding RNAs (Figures 3 and S3).
Importantly, we note that, even when including the entire 30 UTR rather than truncating it by the presence of the next ORF, we obtain a comparable separation to that observed using the truncated 30 UTRs. This demonstrates that the RRS is a robust metric for determining translational status.
