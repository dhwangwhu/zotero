SUMMARY

We identify a type of polycistronic transcript-derived long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are 50 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) capped and 30 polyadenylated (SPAs). SPA processing is associated with nascent mRNA 30 processing and kinetic competition between XRN2 trimming and Pol II elongation. Following cleavage/polyadenylation of its upstream gene, the downstream uncapped pre-SPA is trimmed by XRN2 until this exonuclease reaches the co-transcriptionally assembled snoRNP. This snoRNP complex prevents further degradation, generates a snoRNA 50 end, and allows continuous Pol II elongation. The imprinted 15q11-q13 encodes two SPAs that are deleted in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients. These lncRNAs form a nuclear accumulation that is enriched in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) including TDP43, RBFOX2, and hnRNP M. Generation of a human PWS cellular model by depleting these lncRNAs results in altered patterns of RBPs binding and alternative splicing. Together, these results expand the diversity of lncRNAs and provide additional insights into PWS pathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION In eukaryotic cells, nascent pre-mRNA processing, generally including capping, splicing, and cleavage/polyadenylation (C/ P), is functionally associated with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. 7-methyl guanosine (m7G) capping at the 50 end occurs during the initial phase of Pol II transcription. The cap structure increases mRNA stability, regulates pre-mRNA processing and nuclear export, and stimulates mRNA translation (Cowling, 2009). The mechanism of 30 end processing of nearly all Pol II transcribed RNAs in eukaryotic cells involves C/P of nascent transcripts. The C/P machinery ﬁrst recognizes the AAUAAA

hexanucleotide (or some variants), often together with a downstream G/U-rich sequence present in nascent transcripts, resulting in the endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA by the cleavage and polyadenylation speciﬁcity factors (CPSFs) (Mandel et al., 2006). A poly(A) tail is subsequently added by poly(A) polymerase to the 30 end of the transcript in a non-templated fashion. The 30 end maturation of a pre-mRNA is tightly connected with Pol II termination. Transcription of the poly(A) signal triggers the endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent RNA, generating an upstream cleavage product that is immediately polyadenylated. The remaining downstream cleavage product, with an uncapped phosphate at its 50 end, is highly unstable and is rapidly degraded (Shi et al., 2009). One model explains that the connection between Pol II termination and C/P is the torpedo model (West et al., 2004). The endonucleolytic cleavage at the poly(A) site creates an entry site for XRN2, the 50 /30 exonuclease in humans, to degrade the RNA downstream of the cleavage site. Short nascent RNA induces Pol II elongation complex arrest and promotes termination (Rosonina et al., 2006). The m7G cap and 30 poly(A) are hallmark structures of eukaryotic mRNAs that usually contain multiple exons. These features are also true for most long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (Cabili et al., 2011; Khalil et al., 2009; Ulitsky et al., 2011). However, recent studies have shown that some Pol II transcribed lncRNAs are processed in alternative ways. For example, the excised intron-derived sno-lncRNAs are ended by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) at both ends (Yin et al., 2012). SnoRNAs are a family of conserved RNAs that are concentrated in Cajal bodies or nucleoli where they either function in the modiﬁcation of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) or ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), or participate in the processing of rRNAs during ribosomal subunit maturation (Boisvert et al., 2007; Kiss, 2001; Matera et al., 2007). The great majority of snoRNAs are encoded in the introns of protein-coding genes, and usually one intron  contains one snoRNA gene (Filipowicz and Pogacic, 2002). SnoRNAs are processed from excised and debranched introns by exonucleolytic trimming and carry out their functions in complex with speciﬁc proteins by forming ribonucleoprotein complexes (snoRNPs) (Kiss, 2001). There are two main classes of

snoRNAs: box C/D snoRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs. The box C/D snoRNP contains four key proteins: Fibrillarin (Fib), Nop56, Nop58, and 15.5k (Kiss, 2001). Sno-lncRNAs are formed when one intron contains two snoRNA genes. During splicing, the sequences between the snoRNAs are not degraded, leading to the accumulation of lncRNAs ﬂanked by snoRNA sequences but lacking 50 caps and 30 poly(A) tails (Yin et al., 2012). The genomic region encoding the most abundant sno-lncRNAs in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is speciﬁcally deleted in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) (Figure 1A) (Yin et al., 2012). PWS is a neuro-developmental genetic disorder (Cassidy et al., 2012). The minimal deletion associated with PWS has been mapped to the 30 untranslated region (UTR) of SNURFSNRPN at the imprinted region of 15q11-q13 (Figure 1A) (Bieth et al., 2015; de Smith et al., 2009; Duker et al., 2010; Sahoo et al., 2008). This critical deletion region that causes PWS is paternally transcribed and expresses a number of snoRNAs and lncRNAs (Figure 1A), but a detailed annotation of this important genomic region still has been lacking. Here we identiﬁed two SPAs, a type of previously unreported lncRNAs that are 50 capped by snoRNAs and 30 polyadenylated. These SPAs assemble into a striking nuclear accumulation and affect binding patterns of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and alternative splicing in hESCs, suggesting a link between aberrant localizations of multiple RBPs and PWS pathogenesis. RESULTS Identiﬁcation of SPAs Since the minimal PWS deletion region contains many snoRNAs (Figure 1A), we reasoned that RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) of snoRNP-associated RNAs followed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) would allow us to identify additional snoRNA-related lncRNAs, if any. Fibrillarin is one component of the box C/D snoRNP (Kiss, 2001). We carried out Fib-RIP followed by RNAseq (Fib-RIP-seq) from the human ovarian carcinoma cell line PA1 cells using antibodies against Fib. The expressed box C/D snoRNAs (Table S1) and the known PWS region sno-lncRNAs (Figures S1A and S1B) could be readily precipitated by FibRIP-seq. Unexpectedly, we identiﬁed two SPAs (50 snoRNA capped and 30 polyadenylated lncRNAs) in this imprinted region (Figure 1A and Table S1). SPA1 and SPA2 are sequentially located downstream of the protein-coding bicistronic gene SNURF-SNRPN (Figure 1A). This region has been previously annotated as the 30 UTR of SNRPN. The 50 end of SPA1 correlates with the snoRNA SNORD107 (Figure 1A, bottom panel). SPA1 contains seven exons and is 34,000 nt in length (Figure 1B). We have conﬁrmed

the existence of SPA1 by northern blotting (NB) in H9 cells (Figure 1C) and in PA1 cells (Figure S1C). Furthermore, two phosphorothioate-modiﬁed antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASOs) that targeted different exons of SPA1 both reduced SPA1 to barely detectable levels (Figure 1D), revealing that SPA1 contains multiple exons. We further conﬁrmed that SPA1 could only be precipitated with the anti-Fib antibody (Figure 1E), but not with an anti-m7G cap antibody (Figure 1F), and that SPA1 is only present in the polyadenylated fractionation in PA1 and H9 cells (Figure 1G and data not shown). Although capped by a snoRNP at the 50 end, we observed that the half-life of the polyadenylated SPA1 is similar to that of many m7G capped mRNAs (Figure S1D). In both PA1 and H9 cells, SPA2 is also produced from the PWS deletion region (Figure 1A). The SPA2 gene is located 5.6 kb downstream of SPA1 and contains over 30 exons (Figure S2A). Its 50 end is capped by SNORD109A and is 16,000 nt in length (Figure S2A). The existence of SPA2 in H9 cells was conﬁrmed by NB with probes that recognize its exons across splicing junctions or its last exon, the IPW region (Figure S2B), and by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) (Figure S2C). It should be noted that the last exon of SPA2 was previously annotated as the lncRNA IPW (Wevrick and Francke, 1997). Together, our analyses show that the 30 UTR of SNURF-SNRPN (Kishore and Stamm, 2006; Runte et al., 2001) comprises two additional SPA lncRNAs (Figure S2A). SPA Processing Requires an Intact SnoRNA and a Weak Upstream Poly(A) Signal Nearly all Pol II transcribed exon-containing RNAs in mammals are capped by m7G at their 50 ends to protect RNAs from the 50 exonuclease degradation (Ross, 1995). However, the 50 end of SPA is not m7G capped (Figures 1A and 1F). We asked what mechanism is involved in the 50 end formation of SPA. Nascent RNA-seq in PA1 cells (Zhang et al., 2016) revealed that SPA1 is transcribed from the same promoter as its upstream SNURF-SNRPN gene and is processed from the SNURFSNRPN polycistronic transcript (Figure S2D). We next recapitulated SPA1 formation in an expression vector to investigate its processing in detail. We cloned the last two exons of the SNURF-SNRPN gene (E9+E10) with its endogenous poly(A) signals, the intact 3.4 kb long internal sequence between SNURF-SNRPN and SPA1, and the ﬁrst 800 nucleotides of SPA1 including its 50 end SNORD107, followed by a poly(A) signal embedded in the vector (Figure 2A, left panel). We expected that this vector would transcribe a 5,000 nt pre-RNA, which could be processed into a mRNA containing e9+e10 and SPA (Figure 2A, top right panel). Transfection of this plasmid into

Figure 2. SPA Processing Requires cis-Elements

HeLa cells, which lack endogenous SNURF-SNRPN and SPA1, followed by NB revealed that both e9+e10 and SPA1 could be produced (Figure 2A, lane 1). Importantly, deletion of the intact SNORD107 or its box C, or box C’/D motifs that disrupt the snoRNP structure, could completely eliminate SPA formation, while the expression of e9+e10 remained unchanged (Figure 2A, lanes 2–5). Replacement of the endogenous SNORD107 with another box C/D or box H/ACA snoRNA still allowed SPA1 formation (Figure 2A, lanes 6 and 7). Moreover, RPAs also revealed that the 50 end of SPA1 is a snoRNA in H9 cells, as well as in HeLa cells that were transfected with the SPA1 vector (Figure S3A). These results together demonstrate that the essential motifs of a snoRNA at the 50 end are required for SPA processing. Production of SPA requires continuous Pol II transcription of the downstream region including the snoRNA, after read through of the upstream poly(A) signal. We thus examined whether the strength of the upstream poly(A) signal would have an effect on SPA processing. Deletion of the upstream poly(A) signal, either the AAUAAA C/P recognition sequences (Figure 2B, lane 2), or

the cleavage signal (Figure 2B, lane 3), or both the recognition and cleavage sequences (Figure 2B, lane 4), allowed the upstream RNA to be processed at different levels. A weaker poly(A) strength led to less processed e9+e10. Correspondingly, more pre-RNA accumulation could be observed and more SPA1 could be detected (Figure 2B, right panels). It is worth noting, however, that the complete deletion of the poly(A) signal of e9+e10, together with any possible cryptic poly(A) signals in the 3.4 kb internal sequence downstream, not only completely inhibited the maturation of the upstream e9+e10, but also signiﬁcantly reduced SPA1 processing (Figure 2B, lane 5). These results suggest that the poly(A) signal of the upstream transcript is required for downstream SPA processing from a polycistronic transcript and that different strengths of the upstream poly(A) sequences can affect the downstream SPA processing. In fact, the replacement of endogenous poly(A) sequence with a strong poly(A) signal from the BGH gene led to the strong processing of the upstream e9+e10 but dramatically eliminated SPA1 formation (Figure 2B, lanes 6 and 6*). Altogether, these results reveal that

SPA formation requires an intact snoRNA, which is either a box C/D or a box H/ACA snoRNA and a weak poly(A) signal of its upstream gene in the polycistronic transcript. SPA Processing Requires Protein Factors Involved in the Cleavage/Polyadenylation of Pre-mRNA and the Torpedo Model of Pol II Termination Transcription of the poly(A) signal triggers endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent RNA, generating an upstream cleavage product that is immediately polyadenylated (for example, the upstream e9+e10 mRNA shown in Figures 2A and 2B). The remaining downstream cleavage product, with an uncapped phosphate at its 50 end, is unstable and rapidly degraded. Multiple factors, including CPSF73 and CPSF30, are responsible for the recognition of the poly(A) signal (Chan et al., 2014; Mandel et al., 2006). To determine whether CPSFs play roles in SPA processing, we knocked down CPSF73 or CPSF30 in PA1 cells followed by the examination of the relative abundance of pre-SPA1 and SPA1. Depletion of CPSF73 led to the accumulation of preSPA1 after it was normalized to the upstream snurf-snrpn in the scramble and CPSF73 shRNA treated cells (Figures S3B and S3C). A similar result was obtained by RPA where the accumulation of pre-SPA1 was increased after CPSF73 knockdown (Figure 3A). In addition, depletion of CPSF30, another key factor involved in C/P, also led to the accumulation of pre-SPA1 (Figure S3D). As the torpedo model explains the connection between Pol II termination and C/P (West et al., 2004), we next examined whether XRN2 is involved in SPA processing. Knockdown of XRN2 led to the accumulation of pre-SPA1 from the PWS deletion region, as revealed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3E) and RPA (Figure 3A) in PA1 cells, as well as by reporter assays in HeLa cells (Figure S3F). It should be noted that in all examined situations, knockdown of XRN2 did not signiﬁcantly affect transcription or the processing of the upstream mRNA (Figures S3E and S3F), but only the ratio of the relative abundance of pre-SPA1 and SPA1 was altered (Figure S3F). Together, these results strongly suggest that SPA processing requires factors involved in C/P of the upstream mRNA and XRN2 involved in the torpedo model of Pol II termination. SPA Processing Is Associated with Fast Pol II Transcription Elongation Measuring the Pol II elongation speed by nascent RNA-seq (Zhang et al., 2016) revealed that the Pol II transcription elongation rate (TER) at this locus ($3.4 kb/min) was much higher than the average Pol II speed ($2.5 kb/min) in both H9 and PA1 cells (Figure 3B). This observation suggested that the fast Pol II elongation could allow polymerases to reach SNORD107 before XRN2, allowing the co-transcriptional assembly of a snoRNP to occur. This snoRNP would block the arriving XRN2 degradation from the 50 end of nascent pre-SPA1 and allow the continuous transcription of the polycistronic transcript by fast Pol II. To test this hypothesis, we modulated Pol II TER by expressing the a-amanitin-resistance (Amr) wild-type, R749H (slow Pol II), or E1126G (fast Pol II) of the human Pol II large subunit implicated in elongation control (Fong et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016) in PA1 cells. After transfection with either wild-type or each Pol II

mutant, a-amanitin was added to block endogenous Pol II elongation. We found that the R749H mutant reduced Pol II TER and the E1126G mutant promoted TER (Figure 3C) at the SNURFSNRPN locus as expected (Figure 3C, left panel). Importantly, the relative abundance of the newly processed SPA1, when compared to its upstream snrpn mRNA at the nascent level, was signiﬁcantly decreased or increased in cells with slow or fast Pol II (Figure 3C, right panel). These results thus support our hypothesis that SPA processing requires a fast RNA Pol II TER to win the competition with XRN2. Together, we propose a model for the PWS region SPA1 processing shown in Figure 3D. The paternal transcription at the 15q11-q13 region (Figure 1A) generates a 180 kb long snurfsnrpn polycistronic transcript. It can be processed into both mRNAs and different types of lncRNAs including SPAs and sno-lncRNAs from the previously thought 30 UTR of snurf-snrpn. Fast Pol II transcription elongation coupled with a weak promoter-proximal poly(A) signal allows the continuous transcription of fast Pol II to the downstream region including a snoRNA gene located 3.4 kb away. Following C/P at the 30 end of upstream snurf-snrpn, the nascent uncapped pre-RNA associates with XRN2, which chases the Pol II elongation complex in order to destabilize it. However, Pol II reaches SNORD107 ﬁrst. XRN2 then encounters the co-transcriptionally assembled SNORD107 snoRNP that blocks further degradation of XRN2 and also allows continuous Pol II elongation. Such a mechanism allows the formation of the 50 end snoRNP cap of SPA1. Meanwhile, Pol II continues its transcription until it encounters the next poly(A) signal to initiate another round of cleavage and polyadenylation that forms the 30 end poly(A) tail of SPA1. In addition, SPA2, located 5.6 kb downstream of SPA1, is formed by the same mechanism as SPA1 (gray box, Figure 3D). Since the SPA2 gene also comprises 29 copies of SNORD116s and 5 sno-lncRNAs (Yin et al., 2012) in its introns, we further examined whether SPAs are precursors of these sno-lncRNAs. Treated cells with ASOs that target snrpn mRNA, SPA1, or SPA2 did not signiﬁcantly alter sno-lncRNA expression (Figure 3E), suggesting that these two types of lncRNAs do not have a precursor-product relationship. Indeed, snrpn, SPAs, and sno-lncRNAs are all derived from the same polycistronic transcript (Figure 3D). SPA1 and SPA2 each contains multiple exons and is generated by a mechanism associated with polycistronic transcription, nascent RNA 30 processing, and fast Pol II elongation rate, whereas sno-lncRNAs are derived from the excised introns of SPA2 (Figure 3D). The PWS Region LncRNAs Form a Striking Nuclear Accumulation We have measured the copy number of PWS region SPAs in hESCs. SPAs represent one of the most abundant lncRNAs in hESCs (Figure 3F). For instance, the abundance of SPAs is about one third of that of the lncRNA MALAT1 and is similar to the nonpolyadenylated sno-lncRNAs in hESCs. The nuclear/cytoplasmic RNA fractionation revealed that PWS region SPAs were nuclear retained (Figure S4A). By RNA ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with tiling probes that are antisense to the full length of SPA1, SPA2, or sno-lncRNAs (Figure 4A), we found that these lncRNAs accumulated to a striking

nuclear accumulation in each nucleus of H9 and PA1 cells (Figures 4B and S4B). These accumulations were about 0.4$1.2 mm in diameter, and their volumes were 1$2 mm3 (Figure 4C). Their sizes were larger and greater in H9 cells than those in PA1 cells (Figure 4C). In each subnuclear accumulation, snolncRNAs appeared to be located in the middle, surrounded by SPA1 and SPA2 (Figures 4B and S4B). Double DNA/RNA FISH showed that SPAs accumulated at or near their sites of processing on the paternal chromosome (Figure 4D). To exclude the possibility that the detected signals by RNA FISH were from the partially processed PWS region polycistronic transcript, we blocked Pol II transcription followed by examining the SPA accumulation. 3 hr in Act D or DRB treatment was sufﬁcient to eliminate the polycistronic transcript, with only 5%$12% retaining a barely detectable signal revealed by an intron probe (Figure 4E). In contrast, the SPA1 RNA, although somewhat reduced, remained in 98%$100% of these same nuclei (Figure 4E). Thus, the persistence of PWS region lncRNAs in these transcriptionally inhibited interphase cells is not due to the unprocessed polycistronic transcript. Finally, we found that the striking subnuclear accumulation of SPAs and sno-lncRNAs also existed in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from normal individuals but was absent in iPSCs derived from PWS patients (Yang et al., 2010) (Figure 4F). Conservation of PWS Region SPAs Comparison of human and mouse genomes revealed that the genome organization of SPA1 is largely conserved (Figure S5A). Similar to human SPA1, the 50 end of mouse SPA1 (mSPA1) is Snord107. mSP contains 9 exons, and its predicted size is about 20,000 nt (Figure S5A). However, the homolog of 50 end SNROD109A for the human SPA2 gene is not present in the mouse genome. Indeed, there is a gap missing in the mouse genome that corresponds to the SPA2 locus in human, suggesting that SPA2 lncRNA is not conserved (Figure S5A). Remarkably, although Snrpn is expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and upon neuronal differentiation (Figure S5B), mSPA1 is largely absent in mESCs but highly expressed in neurons (Figure S5B). We further conﬁrmed the expression of mSPA1 in the adult mouse hippocampus tissue, but not in mESCs by NB (Figure S5C). These analyses indicate a different processing of mSPA1 from human SPA1 and the nonconserved feature of the PWS region lncRNAs between mouse and human.

Generation of Allele-Speciﬁc Isogenic hESC Lines Lacking PWS Region LncRNAs Because the PWS region SPAs are not conserved (Figure S5) and the current existing mouse models cannot fully recapitulate the clinical features of human PWS (Cassidy et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2008; Tsai et al., 1999), we decided to generate isogenic hESC lines lacking these lncRNAs by CRISPR/Cas9 to create an unbiased human PWS cellular model. We designed sgRNAs to delete the entire 141 kb genomic region that comprises SPA1 and SPA2 in H9 cells (Figure 5A). As this locus is a genomic imprinting region only transcribed paternally, we selected H9 clones carrying the 141 kb paternal chromosome deletion for a minimum perturbation of the genome. Compared to wild-type (WT) cells, H9 clones having the paternal deletion (P-KO) did not express PWS region lncRNAs (Figures 5A and 5B). The lncRNA-enriched PWS accumulation also disappeared in P-KO cells (Figure S4C). It should be noted that this 141 kb genomic deletion inevitably removed the SPA2 introniclocated SNORD116 snoRNAs, which are orphans and may  possibly lack functional potential (Bazeley et al., 2008; Bratkovic and Rogelj, 2014). H9 P-KO clones of the 141 kb paternal deletion appeared morphologically normal, expressed pluripotency markers, maintained normal karyotype, and could differentiate into all three germ layers (data not shown). RNA-seq and NB revealed little changes in snrpn expression in P-KO cells (Figures 5A and 5C), or few alterations in global gene expression (data not shown). These observations suggest that although the PWS region lncRNAs primarily accumulated to their sites of synthesis (Figure 4), they do not act in cis. Furthermore, knockout of SPAs had no signiﬁcant effect on the CpG methylation status at the imprinting center located upstream of the SNURF-SNRPN locus (data not shown). Together, we conclude that these PWS region SPAs and sno-lncRNAs are not essential for hESCs, consistent with the fact that PWS patients lacking these lncRNAs are viable. PWS Region LncRNAs Sequester RBPs with Distinct Binding Preferences To further explore the role of SPA1, we set up RNA pull-down experiments to identify SPA1-interacting proteins. Since SPA1 is long (Figure 1B), we generated 1,000$2,000 nt sense and antisense biotin-labeled fragments that span almost the full SPA1. After incubation with nuclear extracts isolated from PA1 cells with the biotin-labeled control egfp, sense, or antisense SPA1 fragments, we identiﬁed three RBPs, TDP43, RBFOX2, and

Additional co-localization of SPA1 and TDP43, RBFOX2, and hnRNP M (Figure 5F) also revealed that these proteins were strongly enriched in close proximity to SPA1. Interestingly, additional RNA pull-down assays revealed that SPA2 and sno-lncRNAs also interacted with these RBPs (Figure S6A).

We then performed super-resolution 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to assess the relative localization of each RBP and PWS region lncRNAs. Using 3D SIM, we not only conﬁrmed the co-localization of each RBP with these lncRNAs, but also found that greater than 1% of each RBP could be sequestered there (Figure 5G). Since the diameter of the PWS accumulation and the nucleus is about 0.4$1.2 mm and 10 mm,

immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) with antibodies for TDP43, RBFOX2, and hnRNP M in WT and P-KO H9 cell lines (Figures S6B–S6D and 6A). TDP43, RBFOX2, and hnRNP M in examined H9 cell lines all exhibited binding motifs similar to those previously reported (Huelga et al., 2012; Tollervey et al., 2011; Yeo et al., 2009) (Figure 6B). For example, TDP43 binds to clusters of UG-rich sequences (Tollervey et al., 2011), RBFOX2 binds to UGCAU and GCAUG sequences (Yeo et al., 2009), and hnRNP M binds to clusters of GU-rich sequences that often contain UU sequences within the motif (Huelga et al., 2012). In addition, comparison of the TDP43 iCLIP results in H9 cells between a previously published dataset (Tollervey et al., 2011), and ours revealed that over 70% of TDP43 targeted cDNAs were overlapped (Figure S6E). All of these analyses suggested successful iCLIP assays performed in our hands. For each antibody, we performed iCLIP in duplicate, and only changes detected in both iCLIPs were counted (Figure S6F). iCLIP experiments conﬁrmed that all three proteins directly and strongly interacted with SPA1, SPA2, and sno-lncRNAs in WT H9 cells, but no binding signals could be retrieved in P-KO H9 cells lacking these lncRNAs (Figures 6A and S6G). Calculation of putative binding motifs of these RBPs in these lncRNAs revealed remarkable enrichments of their respective motifs without preference (Figure 6C). Strikingly, a strong preference between lncRNA and RBP was revealed when the binding capability of each RBP on individual PWS region lncRNAs was counted: SPA1 preferred to interact with TDP43, sno-lncRNAs preferred to bind RBFOX2, while SPA2 did not have a preference to these examined RBPs (Figure 6D). SIM further conﬁrmed the binding preference between TDP43 and SPA1 as well as the preference between RBFOX2 and sno-lncRNAs (Figure 6E). Remarkably, SPA1 bound to TDP43 with a strong bias toward its 50 end but interacted with RBFOX2 and hnRNP M more promiscuously (Figures 6F and 6G). Together, these results show that the PWS region lncRNAs form a striking nuclear accumulation that can sequester a signiﬁcant proportion of RBPs with distinct preferences. hESCs Lacking PWS Region LncRNAs Have Altered Patterns of RBP Binding and Alternative Splicing The signiﬁcant enrichment of these RBPs in the PWS region lncRNA-enriched nuclear accumulation in hESCs but not in

PWS patients suggests that the lack of these lncRNAs might alter patterns of RBP binding in PWS patients. Comparing RNA targets of TDP43, RBFOX2, and hnRNP M in WT and P-KO H9 cells revealed changes in the proportion of their associated target RNAs (out of all cDNA counts mapping to the human genome ¨ in each iCLIP dataset after removal of PCR duplicates) (Konig et al., 2010) between WT and P-KO H9 cells (Figures S7A– S7C). We then selected transcripts that have altered RBP binding in P-KO H9 cells; meanwhile, we required that the expression of these RBP associated transcripts remained unchanged in WT and P-KO H9 cell lines (Figures S7A–S7C and Tables S2, S3, and S4). Examples of such transcripts and the proportions of cDNAs that mapped to each transcript in iCLIPs are shown in Figures S7D–S7F. We then analyzed whether the altered RBP binding would result in alternative splicing changes in P-KO hESCs lacking these lncRNAs. 348 altered splicing events repeatedly occurred from RNA-seq of three P-KO lines (Figure 7A and Table S5). 90 among 348 (26%) showed a corresponding change of RBPs binding to pre-mRNAs (Figures 7B–7E and Table S5). Some correlated only with either TDP43 or RBFOX2, and some with both (Figures 7B–7E and S7G and Table S5), but very few correlated with hnRNP M (Figure 7B). Furthermore, the binding of TDP43 and RBFOX2 to these altered pre-mRNAs could be validated in hESCs (Figure 7F). This observation indicates that SPA1 and sno-lncRNAs can regulate different populations of targets. Remarkably, some alternative splicing changes could be found in human iPSCs derived from a reported PWS patient (Yang et al., 2010) (Figure 7G). Intriguingly, a large number of altered binding sites of RBPs were located to genes that do not have cassette exons (Figure S7H), indicating that the PWS region SPAs and sno-lncRNAs can sequester RBPs away from their normal functional sites (Figure 7H). DISCUSSION Most well-characterized lncRNAs that contain multiple exons are capped by m7G. We report here previously unreported nuclear RNAs that are capped by a snoRNP at their 50 ends. SPA processing in the chr15q11-q13 region is associated with fast Pol II transcription elongation and C/P of the upstream gene (Figures

1, 2, and 3). At the SPA-produced SNURF-SNRPN locus, Pol II runs faster than its average speed in both PA1 and H9 cells (Figures 3B and 3C). Such a fast Pol II elongation at this locus would shorten the window of opportunity for the upstream 30 end formation to occur and win the race with XRN2 degradation (Figure 3D). It has been very recently shown that fast transcription elongation could shift termination downstream (Fong et al., 2015). Remarkably, the assembly of snoRNPs downstream of cleavage sites impedes XRN2 degradation and delays Pol II termination (Figure 3). These seamlessly coupled processes together unexpectedly generate SPAs with 50 snoRNP ends at the SNURF-SNRPN locus. As both box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs are capable of mediating SPA formation (Figure 2A), additional genome-wide analyses will be required to identify more SPAs and polycistronic transcripts of this type in different cells. For example, the analysis of publicly available ENCODE datasets revealed a few SPAs that were likely to be generated from the SNORD113 and SNORD115 regions (data not shown). Bacterial and viral mRNAs are often polycistronic (Blumenthal, 1998). The use of alternative translation of bicistronic transcripts to generate protein diversity also exists in mammals (Brubaker et al., 2014), including the SNURF-SNRPN locus. Snurf-snrpn is known as a bicistronic transcript encoding two proteins: SmN, a spliceosomal protein involved in mRNA splicing (Glenn et al., 1996), and a polypeptide SNURF with unknown function (Gray et al., 1999). However, snurf-snrpn produces not only mRNAs and SNROD116 snoRNAs (Bazeley et al., 2008), but also different types of lncRNAs including SPAs and sno-lncRNAs (Figure 3D). While SNROD116s may lack functional signiﬁcance  (Bazeley et al., 2008; Bratkovic and Rogelj, 2014; Cassidy et al., 2012), the two SPAs and ﬁve sno-lncRNAs localize to a close proximity within the 1$2 mm3 sparkle in the nucleus (Figures 4 and S4). This striking co-localization indicates that all of these lncRNAs originating from the snurf-snrpn polycistronic transcript that are not expressed in almost all PWS patients (Figure 1A) might possess similar functions. A least three important RBPs, TDP43, RBFOX2, and hnRNP M, are sequestered by PWS region lncRNAs (Figures 5 and 6). These RBPs are well known to be involved in multiple aspects of mRNA metabolism regulation (Cho et al., 2014; Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2012; Park et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2009; Tollervey et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2008; Yin et al., 2012). Their aberrant localization and expression have been reported to be associated with neurogenetic disorders, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2012; Tollervey et al., 2011) and autism (Voineagu et al., 2011; Weyn-Vanhentenryck et al., 2014). We have previously reported that PWS region snolncRNAs interact with RBFOX2 (Yin et al., 2012). Here we show that SPA1 exhibits a strong preference to TDP43 (Figure 6), suggesting a different role between sno-lncRNAs and SPA1. Analysis of RNA-seq from H9 cells with or without these lncRNAs revealed altered splicing events corresponding to

altered TDP43 and RBFOX2 cross-link clusters (Figure 7). Interestingly, gene ontology showed that some genes with altered cassette exons in P-KO hESC lines were associated with synaptosome and neurotrophin signaling pathways (Figure S7I). For example, RIMS2 is a regulator of synaptic vesicles release, presynaptic plasticity, and insulin secretion (Kaeser et al., 2012; Kashima et al., 2001). DLG1 has a reported role in synaptogenesis (Bonnet et al., 2013; Parkinson et al., 2013). Importantly, altered cassette exons in RIMS2 and DLG1 mRNAs could be found in iPSCs derived from a human PWS patient (Figure 7G). These observations thus suggest a link between the mislocation of RBPs, alternative splicing, and PWS pathogenesis. The observed outcomes in PWS region lncRNA-depleted hESCs are subtle. This is indeed consistent with the fact that PWS patients lacking these lncRNAs are viable. At the molecular level, such changes could be due to the requirement of the cooperativity and synergy between distinct RBPs that act in alternative splicing regulation. For example, we have observed that some alternative splicing events were co-regulated by both TDP43 and RBFOX2 (Figure 7 and Table S5). Alternatively, these RBPs might simply be poised in undifferentiated hESCs but could be more actively involved in a greater degree of splicing regulation upon differentiation. Future studies are warranted to investigate roles of these lncRNAs upon differentiation. Finally, the PWS locus is very complex, with the expression of a number of different noncoding RNAs (SPAs, sno-lncRNAs, and snoRNAs) (Figures 1A and 3D). These RNAs are abundant and processed by unusual pathways. Understanding PWS pathology will thus require isolating the individual contributions of these transcripts, and the current work represents important progress in this direction. More work is needed to identify additional proteins, RNAs, and DNAs in this lncRNA-enriched nuclear accumulation.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RIP Native RIP was carried out as described (Yeo et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2012). See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details. RNA FISH RNA FISH was carried out as described (Yin et al., 2012), and images were acquired on a DeltaVision Elite imaging system. See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details. 3D SIM 3D SIM on ﬁxed samples was performed on a Deltavision OMX V4 system (GE Healthcare). SI image stacks were captured with a z-distance of 0.125 mm and with 5 phases, 3 angles, and 15 raw images per plane. The raw data were reconstructed with channel-speciﬁc OTFs, and a Wiener ﬁlter was set to 0.01 for DAPI channel and 0.002 for other channels using softWoRx 6.5. Images were registered with alignment parameters obtained from calibration measurements with 100 nm diameter TetraSpeck beads (Thermo Scientiﬁc). See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.

(G) Validation of altered cassette exon in P-KO H9 cells. Semi-quantitative RT-PCRs were performed with total RNA from WT and P-KO H9 cells, as well as normal and PWS iPSCs. (H) A proposed model. SPAs and sno-lncRNAs from the PWS deletion region form a striking nuclear accumulation in normal pluripotent cells. These lncRNAs interact with multiple RBPs including TDP43, RBFOX2, and hnRNP M with distinct preferences. HESCs lacking these lncRNAs have altered patterns of RBP binding to pre-mRNAs and alternative splicing. Note that PWS patients don’t have these lncRNAs or the lncRNA-enriched nuclear accumulations.

Generating Allele-Speciﬁc SPA KO hESCs Six sgRNAs (3 targeting upstream and 3 targeting downstream of the deletion) were designed (Table S6) and inserted into one CRISPR/Cas9-nuclease vector px330A by Multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 Assembly System Kit (Addgene) (Sakuma et al., 2014). hESCs were transfected with px330A-SPA using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Roche), and clones were picked up in 2 weeks.
