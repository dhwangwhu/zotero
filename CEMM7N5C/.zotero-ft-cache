Summary High eukaryotic genomes are populated with enhancers, but it has been a major challenge in defining specific enhancer-promoter relationship. Enhancers can also be divided into typical and super-enhancers, yet their functional distinctions remain to be understood. Here, we report a strategy to capture in situ Global RNA Interactions with DNA by deep sequencing (GRID-seq). By deducing general RNA background on chromatin, we unexpectedly detect a highly selective set of RNAs (including both lncRNAs and protein-coding pre-mRNAs) decorated on enhancers, particularly super-enhancers. Based on the origins of those RNAs and functional perturbation of enhancer activities, we are able to infer global enhancer-promoter connectivity, which is significantly beyond the traditional framework. These findings provide a functional RNAchromatin interactome in 3D genome.

Introduction Recent decades of genomic research reveal that mammalian genomes are more prevalently transcribed than previously anticipated 1. It is now quite clear that mammalian genomes express not only protein-coding RNAs but also a large repertoire of non-coding RNAs that have regulatory functions in different layers of gene expression. Many of those regulatory RNAs appear to directly act on chromatin, as exemplified by various lncRNAs
2,3

. Some of

those regulatory RNAs mediate genomic interactions only in cis, while others, such as MALAT1 and NEAT1, are capable of acting in trans 4. These findings suggest an emerging paradigm in regulated gene expression via specific RNA-chromatin interactions. Various techniques have been developed to localize specific RNAs on chromatin. These methods, such as Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification or ChIRP 5, Capture Hybridization

Analysis of RNA Targets or CHART 6, and RNA Affinity Purification or RAP 7, all rely on using complementary sequences to capture a specific RNA followed by deep sequencing to identify targets on chromatin. Importantly, all of these methods only allow analysis of one known RNA at a time, and up to date, a global view is lacking on all RNA-chromatin interactions, which is critical to address a wide range of functional genomics questions. One of the most pressing questions is which enhancers interact with individual gene promoters to regulate gene expression. Current approaches to this problem rely on long distance DNA-DNA interactions detected by Hi-C or ChIA-PET coupled with immunoprecipitation of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and DNA-DNA interaction mediators
8-10

. However, such

interactions are often embedded in numerous static physical interactions confined within largely cell type-independent topologically associating domains (TADs), which would thus impede accurate assignment
11

. Another pressing question concerns the newly introduced concept of

super-enhancers 12,13. As super-enhancers may be argued as a set of stitched typical enhancers 14, it has been unclear whether super-enhancers are indeed superior over typical enhancers in action range, potency or both in activating promoters. To fill these critical gaps, we sought to develop a general approach for systematic localization of all potential chromatin-interacting RNAs in an unbiased fashion. Here we present such an approach for mapping Global RNA Interactions with DNA by deep sequencing (GRIDseq) via using a bivalent linker to ligate RNA to DNA in situ and present a global picture on RNA-chromatin interactions, exposing distinct classes of cis- and trans-chromosomal interacting RNAs in both human and Drosophila genomes. Our analysis reveals a large set of both coding and non-coding RNAs that are prevalently associated with enhancers, particularly superenhancers, which enable us to infer enhancer-promoter connectivity in 3D genomes.

Results Ligating RNA to proximal DNA in situ We chose a triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line to develop a global and unbiased strategy to map RNA-chromatin interactions. To stabilize RNAs on chromatin, we double fixed cells with disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) and formaldehyde, isolated nuclei, and digested DNA in situ with a frequent cutter (AluI). We designed a biotin-labeled bivalent linker consisting of an ssRNA portion for ligation only to RNA and a dsDNA portion for ligation only to DNA (Extended Data Fig.1a). As diagrammed in Fig. 1a, part 1, we first performed RNA ligation in situ, washed away excess free linkers, and extended the DNA primer in the linker into ligated RNA with reverse transcriptase. We next ligated the linker to local genomic DNA followed by affinity purification with streptavidin beads. In Fig. 1a, part 2, we released ssDNA from beads, converted to dsDNA, and used the type II restriction enzyme MmeI to cut DNA ~20 nt upstream and downstream from the two built-in recognition sites in the linker. The products were resolved in native gel to detect two defined DNA fragments with the larger one (~85 bp) corresponding to linker ligation to both RNA and DNA and the smaller one (~65 bp) to linker ligation to either RNA or DNA. We isolated the larger fragment for amplification and adapter ligation for deep sequencing, typically generating >200 million 100 nt raw reads (~40 million uniquely mapped read mates) per library on human cells (see Extended Methods), which showed high concordance between replicates (R2 > 0.95, Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). We developed a strategy for controlling non-specific interactions by mixing isolated nuclei from MDA-MB-231 cells and Drosophila S2 cells (Fig. 1b). Because the human genome is much larger than the Drosophila genome, we mixed human and Drosophila cells in roughly equal molar genome. By using uniquely and unambiguously mapped RNA and DNA read mates

4

to human or Drosophila genome (see Extended Methods), we estimated 6.8% human RNA linked to Drosophila DNA and 8.4% Drosophila RNA linked to human DNA (Fig. 1b). While these cross-species mates were likely resulted from ligation of fragmented RNAs in solution, which randomly landed on exposed chromatin during the GRID-seq reaction, the majority of RNA-chromatin interactions we detected reflected in situ interactions in both human and Drosophila genomes. Such non-specific cross-genome interactions in fact enabled us to construct a general background, which is essential to evaluate specific RNA-chromatin interactions within each genome (see below).

Identifying hit RNAs on chromatin We rank-ordered genes based on RNA reads on chromatin, observing a set of RNAs, including both known lncRNAs and various pre-mRNAs, that prevalently interacted with chromatin in both human and Drosophila genomes (red-labeled in Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2a). These chromatin-interacting RNAs are expressed from a small fraction of active genes with RNA reads evenly derived from their gene bodies, yet account for ~90% of all detected RNAs on chromatin (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Close examination of individual examples revealed that many RNAs showed discrete binding while others exhibited relatively scattered distribution on chromatin. We therefore plotted length-normalized abundance of RNAs against their highest binding density on chromatin to identify RNAs with sufficient densities in both RNA reads and interactions on chromatin, leading to 973 “hit” RNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Table 1). These hit RNAs consist of both small RNAs (2.1%, which predominantly correspond to snRNAs and snoRNAs, orange-labeled in Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 2c) and long RNAs (including 6.7% lncRNAs and 87.1% protein-coding pre-mRNAs, red-labeled in Fig. 1d,

5

Extended Data Fig. 2c). When compared with gene expression, it became evident that hit RNAs are not necessarily from highly expressed genes in both human and Drosophila cells (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). These data revealed a set of RNAs with propensity to frequently and specifically interact with chromatin in human and Drosophila genomes. Taking advantage of the small Drosophila genome, thus having sufficient density of human RNAs linked to its genome, we constructed a background for non-specific RNAchromatin interactions. Besides randomly fragmented RNAs, expressed RNAs are also known to extensively explore nuclear space after being released from their sites of transcription 15. We thus reasoned that trans-chromosomal signals from pre-mRNAs of protein-coding genes might be used to construct a background. Indeed, such deduced background with endogenous RNAs in Drosophila S2 cells is highly concordant with that built from trans-species RNA-chromatin interactions (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). This suggests that we may use endogenous RNAs to build a similar background for human cells, which is reproducible based on replicated GRID-seq datasets (Extended Data Fig. 3c). GRID-seq signals significantly above the background may therefore reflect RNAs that either traveled extensively to engage in specific trans-chromosomal interactions or interacted with chromatin in spatial proximity to their sites of transcription.

Global view of RNA-chromatin interactions When displaying all hit RNAs on chromosomes in the human genome after normalization against the background (Extended Methods), it was clear that the majority of RNAs interacted with chromatin near their sites of transcription, and surprisingly, a limited number of RNAs were extensively engaged in trans-chromosomal interactions, such as U2 snRNA and two pseudo U2 snRNAs, MALAT1 and NEAT1 (Fig. 2a). Both MALAT1 and NEAT1 reside in Chromosome 11

6

and an enlarged view of Chromosomes 11 and 17 showed their prevalent interactions with similar efficiency on all other chromosomes in the human genome. Further analysis revealed their general preference for active chromatin regions, such as promoters marked by H3K4me3 and active enhancers decorated with H3K27ac (Extended Data Fig. 4a), which were concordant with previous reports
6,16

. We also detected abundant 7SK RNA on chromatin (Extended Data

Fig. 4a), similar to the signals detected by ChIRP 17, but its interactions with chromatin in most locations were similar to background (Fig. 2a), as background RNA-chromatin interactions also tend to associate with open chromatin (Extended Data Fig. 4b). With the expended chromosomal view, we noted multiple coding (pc) and non-coding (nc) RNAs that are able to interact with numerous loci in the same chromosomes (Fig. 2b), suggesting that these RNAs may help define (as either cause or consequence) nuclear territories in the cell. Such extensive RNA interactions with chromatin are highly reproducible based on replicated GRID-seq experiments, even with increasing resolutions (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). In Drosophila S2 cells, we also detected a large number of RNAs on chromatin, and enlarged chromosomal view showed roX2, a lncRNA known to be involved in dosage compensation in Drosophila 18, decorated only on Chromosome X (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We further compared our roX2-chromatin interaction results with the published roX2 ChIRP and ChART data
5,6

as well as the ChIP-seq data on MSL3, a known roX2-interacting factor

19

and

observed a high degree of concordance among all mapping results on Chromosome X (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). These data unambiguously demonstrated the ability of unbiased GRID-seq to recapitulate known specific RNA-chromatin interactions, thus empowering discovery and characterization of new RNA-chromatin interactions.

7

RNA-chromatin interaction ranges Some RNAs appeared to interact with chromatin within rather confined regions while others showed more broad chromatin interactions within the same chromosomes as well as specific interactions across chromosomes. We therefore characterized hit RNAs based on their chromatin-interacting ranges in local (±10 Kb from their genes), cis (beyond local regions) or trans (across chromosomes). We first analyzed such behaviors of lncRNAs, observing that the majority of lncRNAs showing all three modes of chromatin interactions with a few exceptions (Fig. 2c). A set of lncRNAs, as exemplified by HCG18, were rarely engaged in trans-

chromosomal actions, while U2 snRNA showed no local action, likely because it interacts with chromatin during co-transcriptional splicing only after being assembled into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP). Circos plots
20

further illustrated the ability of MALAT1 to

interact with chromatin in all three modes and with similar efficiency, while PVT1 was predominantly engaged in local and cis-chromosomal interactions (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, when the same analysis was applied to chromatin-interacting pre-mRNAs, the majority of them were able to participate in all three modes of interactions, but without any exclusively acting in trans (Fig. 2e). Circos plots again showed HMGA2 pre-mRNA interacted with chromatin in all three modes, although with much reduced frequencies in transchromosomal interactions, while SMAD5 pre-mRNA interactions with chromatin were largely confined in local and cis-chromosomal interactions (Fig. 2f). These findings suggest that many pre-mRNAs may behave like lncRNAs in the nucleus. Additionally, while Drosophila S2 cells showed the same trend as human cells, a much larger number of small RNAs, predominantly snoRNAs, were involved in chromatin interactions in all three modes (Extended Data Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 1).

Cell type-specific interactions We next wondered whether specific RNA-chromatin interactions we discovered reflect cell type-specific activities in mammals, and therefore extended GRID-seq analysis to another well-characterized human multiple myeloma cell line MM.1S, which would enable us to take advantage of previously generated functional data on this cell type 21. As on MDA-MB-231 cells, we again detected a set of trans-acting RNAs, including MALAT1 and NEAT1 (Extended Data Fig. 8a), as well as both coding and non-coding RNAs that broadly interacted with numerous loci near their sites of transcription. Interestingly, we detected XIST (expressed in MM.1S cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells), which extensively decorated on Chromosome X (Extended Data Fig. 8b), further demonstrating the power and accuracy of GRID-seq in identifying specific RNA-chromatin interactions. Interestingly, cross analysis between MDA-MD-231 and MM.1S cells revealed cell typespecific RNA-chromatin interactions (Fig. 3a,b), as exemplified by different RNA signals on Chromosome 4 (Fig. 3c) and by differential binding of a selective set of hit RNAs on Chromosome 6 (Fig. 3d). In contrast, background RNA-chromatin interactions were similar between MDA-MB-231 and MM.1S cells (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). This is reminiscent of enhancers, the majority of which are cell type and tissue-specific, as shown previously based on H3K4me1/2 and H3K27ac 22. Indeed, we noted that nearly all chromatin-interacting RNAs were linked to both shared and cell type-specific enhancers (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 9c,d) and in a quantitative fashion (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f) in both MDA-MB-231 and MM.1S cells. This can be directly visualized on specific examples, showing not only cell type-specific interactions of RNAs with their own genes but also with nearby enhancers (Fig. 3f,g). Surprisingly, even with

9

the same RNA detected in both cells, it reached out to distinct enhancers (Fig. 3h), suggesting cell type-specific rewiring of transcription program. Although we did not have sufficient read density for eRNAs, which are believed to link enhancers to promoters 23, our data indicated that pre-mRNAs from actively transcribed genes were also associated with their enhancers, perhaps reflecting putative hubs for enhancer-promoter interactions in the nucleus.

Prevalent RNAs on super-enhancers Recent studies suggested that enhancers can be segregated into typical and superenhancers, the latter of which were defined based on much higher density of enhancer marks, such as MED1 and BRD4 ChIP-seq signals, which generally tracked H3K27ac, and importantly, such “stitched” enhancers appeared to be more potent in activating nearby genes
13,21

. Given

most enhancers were associated with GRID-seq signals, we sought to determine whether such signals could also be used to define the strength of typical versus super-enhancers. By sorting enhancers based on RNA coverage, we found that enhancers highly decorated with RNAs mostly corresponded to super-enhancers in both MDA-MB-231 and MM.1S cells (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 9g), which was also evidenced by much higher RNA coverage on super-enhancers relative to typical enhancers in both cell types (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 9h). Therefore, chromatin-associated RNAs may provide yet another independent measure of enhancer activities. As super-enhancers are more potent than typical enhancers in activating nearby genes in MM.1S cells
21

, we sorted the GRID-seq signals based on RNA coverage and compared the

expression of neighboring genes from 50 Kb flanking enhancers by using the published gene expression data on MM.1S cells. We found that genes adjacent to top 10% RNA-decorated enhancers were more active than those adjacent to bottom 10% (Fig. 4c,d), and similarly, the

10

genes associated with top 10% RNA-decorated enhancers were more responsive than those with bottom 10% to functional perturbation with the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 (Fig. 4e), thus confirming the previous conclusions
13,21

. We performed the same set of experiments on MDA-MB-231

cells by using GRO-seq to score nascent RNA production and transcriptional response to JQ1, and reached the same conclusions (Extended Data Fig. 9i,j,k). Combined, these data suggest that the levels of chromatin-associated RNAs reflect enhancer activities in activating gene expression, which can be used to differentiate super from typical enhancers.

Inferring enhancer-promoter connectivity One of the fundamental problems in regulated gene expression is to pair enhancers and promoters. In fact, published ChIA-PET and Hi-C experiments have already indicated that enhancers may reach out to promoters that are far away in terms of linear DNA distance
24,25

.

However, numerous static long-distance DNA-DNA interactions tend to obscure true enhancerpromoter interactions in those experiments, as TADs are largely cell type invariant
11

. We

therefore sought to use chromatin-interacting RNAs to infer potential enhancer-promoter relationships. Interestingly, as exemplified on MM.1S cells, RNAs tend to reach out from their sites of transcription to a medium distance of ~1 Mb (Fig. 5a). As enhancers tend to attract RNA in general, we used trans-chromosomal interaction signals of protein-coding RNAs to deduce a statistical model for trans-chromosomal interacting RNAs on enhancers, and by using a highly stringent criterion of z ≥ 3, we identified RNAchromatin interactions that likely reflect the physical proximity between gene loci and enhancers (Extended Data Fig. 10a). This analysis clearly suggests that enhancers may reach out to

11

promoters significantly beyond the traditional confinement of 50 Kb, but interestingly, typical and super-enhancers seem to have a similar action range (Extended Data Fig. 10b,c). We next visualized GRID-seq defined enhancer-promoter network with Cytoscape by using self-organized layout 26, as illustrated on Chromosome 1 and with several enlarged views in MM.1S cells (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Table 2). Based on this network, we found that each enhancer, whether typical or super, seemed to control 1 or 2 genes in most cases (Fig. 5c). In contrast, each gene seemed to be regulated by multiple typical enhancers, but a given gene is only associated with 1 or 2 super-enhancers (Fig. 5d). Because these observations may be interpreted to indicate that super-enhancers are many individual enhancers stitched together, our finding at least suggests that super-enhancers do not control more genes than typical enhancers.

Functional evidence for connectivity Because chromatin-interacting RNAs enabled the estimation of long-distance enhancerpromoter connectivity significantly beyond the traditional framework, we next wished to seek functional evidence for newly predicated enhancer-promoter partnerships. On a specific

example in MM.1S cells, RNAs from two transcribing genes (SNX5 and RPBP1) were interacting with one super-enhancer and six typical enhancers (Extended data Fig. 10d). In response to JQ1 treatment, both genes were down regulated (Extended data Fig. 10e) and the super-enhancer showed more reduced BRD4 binding than all other typical enhancers (Extended Data Fig. 10f). We next extended the analysis to all RNA connected enhancers and promoters in MM.1S cells, asking whether genes associated with at least one super-enhancers (plus typical enhancers) might be more sensitive to perturbation of enhancer activities by JQ1 than those only linked to typical enhancers. We found that genes associated with at least one super-enhancer

12

were indeed more responsive to JQ1 treatment than those only linked to typical enhancers based on GRID-seq signals within the traditional 50 Kb range (Fig. 5e), and importantly, we made the same observation based on the connectivity without setting any action range (Fig. 5f). These data suggest that chromatin-interacting RNAs may indeed be used to deduce long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions and that super-enhancers are superior in activating both local and distal genes. Our analysis has been focused on cis-chromosomal interactions, but numerous RNAs were still able to reach out to loci in other chromosomes with sufficient significance based on our trans-chromosomal interaction model, implying the formation of enhancer-promoter hubs even between chromosomes in 3D genome. To visualize such interactions, we then displayed the network of all deduced enhancer-promoter interactions in MM.1S cells with Cytoscape by using self-organized layout. Strikingly, the resulting global network revealed that individual chromosome tended to cluster into multiple intra-chromosomal hubs, each centered by gene(s) expressing chromatin-associated RNAs, many of which were also connected with other chromosomes (Fig. 5g). These findings suggest that chromatin-interacting RNAs may be used to construct a functional 3D map that resembles the chromosomal organization in the nucleus.

Discussion We present a method for unbiased global detection and analysis of RNA-chromatin interactions, which will be a powerful tool for studying regulatory RNAs on chromatin. To infer specific RNA-chromatin interactions, we established a strategy to set the background for nonspecific RNA-chromatin interactions by mixing human and Drosophila nuclei. Interestingly, such true background is comparable to that built with endogenous RNAs, thus permitting the use

13

of endogenous RNAs to construct background in human cells. Because those “non-specific” RNAs tend to search for open chromatin to interact, it is important to keep in mind that such background may obscure some specific RNA-chromatin interactions. In any case, a major surprise is relatively few RNAs capable of engaging in trans-chromosomal interactions in the human genome, MALAT1 and NEAT1 being the major lncRNAs as reported in literature. Interestingly, unlike human cells, a large number of snoRNAs appear to participate in chromatin interactions in Drosophila S2 cells, raising an intriguing possibility that various snoRNAs may have important roles at the chromatin levels in Drosophila. The identification of many

unannotated chromatin-interacting transcripts provides rich recourses for future functional studies. Besides trans-chromosomal chromatin-interacting RNAs, we detected a large set of chromatin-interacting RNAs that are not necessarily from the most highly expressed genes in the cell. Strikingly, many of these RNAs are able to reach out to chromatin that are megabases away in linear DNA distance, and in some extreme cases, specific RNAs can decorate the entire chromosome arm or the full chromosome, which has only one precedent XIST in human and one precedent roX1/2 in Drosophila cells, both involved in X-chromosome dosage compensation 18,27. These findings beg yet another intriguing question on whether some RNAs are involved in dosage compensation or other large-scale regulatory activities in various autosomes. Strikingly, the majority of specific chromatin-interacting RNAs are associated with enhancers marked by H3K4me1/2 and H3K27ac. Recent studies suggest that a subset of

enhancers may be considered super-enhancers because of their clustered distribution in mammalian genomes
12,13,21

.

Interestingly, about half of all chromatin-interacting RNAs

detected by GRID-seq in two mammalian cell types decorated on those super-enhancers,

14

therefore providing an independent measure for enhancer activities.

Based on functional

perturbation of enhancer activities, previous studies also indicate that super-enhancers appear to be more potent than typical enhancers in enhancing gene expression and more sensitive to inhibition of BRD4
21

. Our analysis based on GRID-seq signals confirmed the previous

conclusions and further revealed that super-enhancers are similar to typical enhancers in action range. We took advantage of chromatin-interacting RNAs to address an outstanding question on enhancer-promoter connectivity, which has been inferred in various cases by long-distance DNA-DNA interaction data, especially those enriched with critical transcription factors, such as RNA Pol II
10,28

, or indirectly deduced via enhancer-promoter units (EPUs) based on their co-

regulation patterns in different tissues 29. Functional studies also validated some of those inferred relationships in various biological contexts
30,31

. Importantly, our data enable us to infer global

enhancer-promoter connectivity without constraint of the traditional boundary of ~50 Kb, which is in fact in line with examples based on physical DNA-DNA interactions 25,32. We envision that such “long-distance” interactions are actually quite local in the 3D space of the nucleus, and therefore, enhancers, particularly super-enhancers, may share hubs with gene promoters they regulate. Thus far, we have been only using chromatin-interacting RNAs to relate to various gene activities, but an important question to be addressed in future studies is whether those RNAs may actually play more active roles in nucleating enhancer-promoter hubs. Furthermore, while many of those chromatin-interacting RNAs are well-characterized lncRNAs, the majority are actually pre-mRNAs transcribed from typical protein-coding genes. This implies that many such premRNAs may function as lncRNAs in nucleus. In fact, increasing evidence suggests the

15

functional importance of nascent RNAs from both pre-mRNAs and lncRNAs in meditating a range of regulatory activities on chromatin, as exemplified by the recruitment of a de novo DNA methyltransferase 33, transcriptional activators 34,35, or repressors 36-38. The GRID-seq technology is therefore expected to expedite the discovery of a variety of RNA-mediated regulatory activities on chromatin.

Extended Methods Cell culture MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (HTB-26 ATCC) and MM.1S multiple myeloma cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Thermo Fisher Sci.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MM.1S cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 1% GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Sci.) and 10% fetal bovine serum. For JQ1 treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells were resuspended in fresh media containing 500 nM JQ1 (a gift from Cheng-Ming Chiang, UT Southwestern) or 0.05% DMSO as vehicle for a duration of 6 h. Drosophila S2 cells were cultured in Schneider's Drosophila Medium (Thermo Fisher Sci.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM Lglutamine (Thermo Fisher Sci.), at room temperature in ambient CO2.

Construction of GRID-seq library A bivalent linker was chemically synthesized (IDT), as illustrated in Extended Data Fig.1. The DNA strand consists of: 5’-

/5Phos/GTTGGAGTTCGGTGTGTGGGAGTGAGCTGTGTC -3’, and the DNA/RNA hybrid strand contains 5’-

/5Phos/rGrUrUrGrGrArUrUrCrNrNrNrGrACACAGC/iBiodT/CACTCCCACACACCGAACTC CAAC -3’ (rN: Random ribonucleotide; iBiodT: biotin-conjugated T). The DNA/RNA hybrid stand was pre-adenylated by using the DNA 5’ Adenylation Kit (NEB) following manufacturer instruction, and was purified by Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol (pH 8.0, Thermo Fisher Sci.) followed by ethanol precipitation. Equal molar quantity of the two stands were mixed, incubated at 80°C for 5 min, and annealed after slow cooling to room temperature at

20

approximately 0.1°C per sec. The annealed linker was adjusted to the final concentration of 8 pmol/µl. Approximately 2 million mammalian cells or 10 million Drosophila cells were used for each GRID-seq library construction. Cells were washed twice with PBS and crosslinked for 45 min at room temperature with 2 mM PBS-diluted DSG solution. Cells were washed and further crosslinked for 10 min at room temperature with 3% PBS-diluted formaldehyde solution followed by quenching formaldehyde with 350 mM Glycine. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 500 µl of Buffer A (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 1 U/µL RiboLock (Thermo Fisher Sci.), 1× Protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich.)) for 15 min on ice. To prepare nuclei, fixed cells were washed in 200 µl of 1× Tango Buffer (Thermo Fisher Sci.) and then incubated in 320 µl of Buffer B (1× Tango Buffer, 0.2% SDS) for 10 min at 62˚C. SDS was immediately quenched with 50 µl of 10% Triton X-100 and the integrity of nuclei was examined under microscope. Nuclei were collected, washed twice with 1× Tango Buffer, resuspended in 500 µl of AluI solution (1× Tango Buffer, 1 U/µl RiboLock, 1× Protease inhibitor, 1% Triton X100, 0.5 U/µl AluI (Thermo Fisher Sci.)), and incubated at 37˚C for 2 h with agitation. Nuclei were collected, resuspended in 400 µl of PNK solution (1× Tango Buffer, 1 U/µl RiboLock, 1× Protease inhibitor, 1 mM ATP, 0.35 U/µl T4 PNK (Thermo Fisher Sci.)), and incubated at 37˚C for 1.5 h with agitation. For in situ linker ligation to RNA, prepared nuclei were washed twice with 200 µl of 1× RNA Ligase Buffer (NEB), resuspended in 500 µl of RNA ligation solution (1× RNA Ligase Buffer, 1 U/µl RiboLock, 0.4 pmol/µl pre-adenylated linker, 4 U/µL T4 RNA Ligase 2-truncated KQ (NEB), 15% PEG-8000), and incubated at 25°C for 2 h. For primer extension, 10 µl of H2O, 36 µl of 1 M KCl, 32 µl of 10 mM dNTP mix, 28 µl of 5× RT First Strand Buffer (Thermo

21

Fisher Sci.), 28 µl of 100 mM DTT and 5 µl of SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase were mixed directly into the suspension, and the reaction was incubated at 50°C for 45 min. For in situ linker ligation to AluI-cut genomic DNA, nuclei were collected, washed twice with 200 µl of 1× DNA Ligase Buffer (NEB) to remove free linker, resuspended in 1.2 ml of DNA Ligation Solution (0.2 U/µl RiboLock, 1× DNA Ligase Buffer, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 U/µl T4 DNA Ligase (Thermo Fisher Sci.)) and incubated overnight at 16°C with rotation. Nuclei were collected, washed with PBS, resuspended in 266 µl of Proteinase K solution (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mg/ml Proteinase K (Thermo Fisher Sci.) and incubated at 65˚C for 30 min. After adding 20 µl of 5 M NaCl, protease-treated nuclei were incubated for another 1.5 h. Total DNA was extracted, dissolved in B&W Buffer (5 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.02% Tween-20). 300 µg of Streptavidinconjugated magnetic beads were washed with B&W Buffer and mixed with purified DNA for affinity purification of biotinylated linker. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, beads were extensively washed for 5 times with B&W Buffer, and incubated in 100 µl of 150 mM NaOH at room temperature for 10 min. Cleared supernatant was collected, neutralized with 6.5 µl of 1.25 M Acetic Acid, and diluted with 11 µl of 10× TE Buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA). Released ssDNA was precipitated by isopropanol from the supernatant and dissolved in 30 µl of H2O. Second strand synthesis was performed by mixing ssDNA with 250 ng Random Hexamer Primers and 5 µl of 10× NEB Buffer CutSmart, incubating at 98°C for 5 min, adding 8.5 µl of H2O, 5 pmol dNTP and 5 U Klenow Fragment (3' to 5' exo-) enzyme (NEB) and incubating at 37°C for 1 h. After heat inactivation at 70°C for 10 min, 5 pmol Sadenosylmethionine (NEB) and 1 U MmeI enzyme (NEB) was added and incubated at 37°C for 30 min followed by addition of another 3 U MmeI and incubation for 30 min. The reaction was

22

treated with 40 µg Proteinase K at 65°C for 20 min. Digested DNA was extracted and purified before loading to 12% native PAGE gel for size-selection. The desired band at 84 bp was excised and DNA was extracted. Adapters were prepared by annealing the following two oligonucleotides (IDT) in 1× NEB Buffer 2 to a final concentration of 25 mM: 5’-/5Phos/AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT3’ and 5’-ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTNN-3’. Purified DNA was dissolved in 10 µl of 1× NEB Buffer CutSmart and 0.5 U Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (NEB), incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and heat inactivated at 65°C for 5 min. The reaction was diluted with 36 µl H2O, mixed with 10 µl of 10× T4 DNA Ligase Buffer (NEB), 32 µl of PEG-6000, 200 pmol of Adapters and 1,600 U T4 DNA Ligase (NEB), and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Unligated nick was phosphorylated by 20 U T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB) supplemented by 100 pmol ATP and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Nick was then ligated by addition of 1 µl of 10× T4 DNA Ligase Buffer, 100 pmol ATP and 1,600 U T4 DNA Ligase (NEB), and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. DNA along with excessive Adapters were extracted and purified before loading to 10% native PAGE gel for size-selection. The desired band at approximately 185 bp was excised. DNA was extracted and dissolved in 20 µl of H2O. To amplify each library, 20 µl of PCR amplification mix (9.4 µl of H2O, 5 µl of DNA sample, 4 µl of 5× Phusion HF Buffer, 40 pmol dNTP, 5 pmol Primer#1, 5 pmol Primer#2, 0.4 U Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Sci.)) was prepared. PCR primers consist of Primer#1 (5’-

AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACBBBBBACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCT CTTCCGATCT -3’ (BBBBB: 5 nt barcode for multiplexing libraries)) and Primer#2 (5’CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT -3’). PCR was performed

23

with an initial 30 sec denaturation at 98°C, followed by 16 cycles of 10 sec denaturation at 98°C, 30 sec annealing at 65°C and 15 sec extension at 72°C. The PCR product was separated on a native 10% PAGE gel and the band at 188 bp was recovered. DNA was subsequently subjected to Illumina HiSeq 2500 for single-end 100 bp sequencing, with the sequencing primer (5’ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT -3’).

Parallel analysis of Human-Drosophila mixed nuclei To set up a Human-Drosophila mix, MDA-MB-231 and S2 cells were independently double-crosslinked and collected, from which nuclei were isolated and counted. Pilot experiments indicated that human MDA-MB-231 nuclei and Drosophila S2 nuclei at a 1:5 ratio contain roughly equal amounts of total nucleic acid, and accordingly, 1 million MDA-MB-231 nuclei and 5 million S2 nuclei were mixed. The construction of the mix library was performed in parallel with 2 million MDA-MB-231 cell nuclei and 10 million S2 cell nuclei.

GRID-seq raw data processing and mapping Upon sequencing, individual libraries were segregated according to multiplexing barcodes and then both barcode and residual adapter sequences were removed from each tag to produce tags with non-uniform length, the majority of which ranged from 84 bp to 87 bp in each library. To precisely remove linker sequence from the DNA and cDNA tags, MmeI motifs were used for defining linker boundaries. Linker orientation also dictated whether the tags at each side were originated from genomic DNA or RNA. To minimize the loss of tags due to sequencing errors, tags were first filtered based on the presence of two opposite-orientated MmeI motifs, then aligned to the linker sequence from both directions to determine its orientation. DNA and

24

corresponding RNA tags, most of which ranged from 18 bp to 23 bp, were extracted for alignment. All processed tags were aligned to their indicated genome build using Bowtie2 with parameter of --local
40

. Human samples were aligned to genome build hg38 and Drosophila

samples to genome build dm3 with parameters -q 2. To estimate the numbers of cross-speciesligated RNA and DNA tags in the mix of MDA-MB-231 and S2 cell nuclei, RNA tags were first aligned independently to the transcriptome builds of hg38 and dm3, with the most stringent parameter of -q 44. Linked DNA tags of those RNA tags that were unambiguously aligned to human transcriptome were then aligned to human genome with the parameter of -q 2. These DNA tags failed to align to the human genome were then aligned to the Drosophila genome, with the parameter of -q 2. Conversely, DNA tags linked to the RNA tags that were unambiguously aligned (-q 44) to the Drosophila transcriptome were first aligned to the Drosophila genome (-q 2), and those unaligned DNA tags were then aligned to the human genome (-q 2) Seven GRID-seq libraries were generated from the current study:

Identification of hit RNAs

25

Genomic regions with enriched GRID-seq RNA reads were detected by MACS2 41 using the model for broad-peak detection. These mapped regions with significant enrichment (p < 0.001) and overlapping with known-gene annotation (Ensemble genes GRCh38.83 for human and BDGP5.78 for Drosophila) were assigned to their respective largest annotated genes. Enriched regions that did not overlap with any known gene were assigned as “unannotated transcripts”. The RNA read-coverage of genomic regions was calculated by BEDtools
42

and

SAMtools 43. The genes with the tag-coverage above the sliding-window threshold [(Ni+n - Ni) ≥ n, where i was the rank of given RNA, N was the read-counts of this RNA and n was the 1/100 of the total number of ranked RNAs] were selected as abundant chromatin-interacting RNAs. A subset of abundant RNAs with sufficient RNA read-density [RPK (reads per Kb) ≥ 100] or with significant DNA read-densities (RPK ≥ 10) associated at any genomic region was identified as hit RNAs for further analysis (Supplementary Table 1).

Construction of background for non-specific RNA-chromatin interactions To determine the specific RNA-chromatin interaction pattern of each hit RNA, we developed a genome-wide background for non-specific interactions. Ideally, for each library, we could setup mixed nuclei from different species in order to evaluate cross-species RNAchromatin interactions, which would represent the true background. In practice, it is feasible to generate such background with sufficient density on the Drosophila genome by using RNA reads from human cells because of the much smaller Drosophila genome, but the RNA density on the human genome based on the RNA reads from Drosophila is often too scattered to provide a reliable background. We thus sought to deduce the background in the Drosophila genome based on endogenous RNA reads in comparison with the true background based on cross-species RNA-

26

chromatin interactions. Toward this goal, we selected RNAs from protein-coding genes engaged in trans-chromosomal interactions, and calculated their density on the 1 Kb-binned genome. Such deduced background read-density at each 1 Kb bin was then smoothed by a moving widow of 100 Kb and normalized by the total read number and chromosome size. The resulting background in the Drosophila genome was highly correlated with the cross-species background. This strategy enabled us to deduce the background on any human cells by using endogenous RNA reads.

Normalization of RNA-chromatin interactions and construction of genomic binding matrix To evaluate specific RNA-chromatin interactions of each hit RNA at each genomic bin, we first summarized the DNA reads for each gene at each genomic bin, and then normalized them to 1 million reads followed by further normalization of total number of bins of each chromosome. A ratio was next calculated by dividing the normalized DNA read density with background read density, which represents specific binding of this RNA at the genomic bin. To construct a robust global binding matrix for all hit RNAs, genomic bins with significant binding level (at least 3 bins with binding level ≥ 2 in every 10 bin-window) were preserved and further smoothed by a moving-widow of 10 bins. All subsequent analyses involving binding levels and patterns were based on such genomic binding matrix.

Identification of active enhancers and inference of enhancer–promoter connectivity Active enhancers were identified by using published H3K27ac ChIP-seq data 21. Briefly, enriched peaks of H3K27ac were first detected by MACS2; the peaks within 2.5 Kb around

27

known promoters were removed; and the qualified peaks were stitched together if they were within a 12.5 Kb region. As specific binding at enhancers indicated specific footprints of hit RNA on the chromatin, we built a statistical model to identify significant long-distance RNA-chromatin interactions between enhancer and promoters based on trans-chromosomal interactions from hit RNAs of protein-coding genes. We used this model and selected a stringent confidence threshold (Z-score ≥ 3) to segregate the interaction levels of travelling RNAs across the nuclear space from those likely due to the spatial proximity in 3D genome.

Construction of enhancer-promoter network The enhancer-promoter network based on significant intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions was constructed with inferred enhancer-promoter pairs at different significance levels (Supplementary Table 2). The network of the Chromosome 1 in MM.1S cell was built based on RNA-chromatin interactions of all the hit genes in the chromosome at a very stringent significance (z ≥ 3), and the network of the whole genome was based on significant RNAchromatin interactions from protein-coding genes with slightly reduced stringency (z ≥ 2). The network was then imported into Cytoscape (version 3.3), a versatile software for network visualization and analysis, and displayed with a self-organized layout algorithm, Edge-Repulsive Spring-Electric Layout, supported by the third-party app of AllegroLayout 26.

Functional perturbation of general enhancer activities MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 or DMSO for 6 h, and immediately harvested for global nuclear run-on
23,44

. To quantify transcription activities in an

28

unbiased manner, GRO-seq read densities were initially normalized using total uniquely-mapped read numbers to remove variations between libraries. To minimize the bias introduced by promoter pausing or gene length, only reads that were aligned within the 2 Kb region 1 Kb downstream from the TSS were selected to calculate the transcription activity. For multi-isoform genes, the transcript with highest read counts within the 2 Kb window was selected to represent the gene’s transcription activity.

Red-labeled are genes that passed the inflection. b, Top: Percentages of genes that gave to GRID-seq RNA reads in different classes. Bottom: The distribution of GRID-seq detected RNAs along the gene body in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Dashed lines are the set thresholds for specific hits with red dots for long RNAs and orange dots for small RNAs. d, Comparison between gene expression detected by RNA-seq (GSM480160) and chromatin-interacting RNAs detected by GRID-seq for all expressed genes in Drosophila S2 cells. Grey dots are genes not showing frequently interactions with DNA as in a, and colored genes correspond to those in c. e, Visualization of GRID-seq RNA reads in two scales (first two tracks) in comparison with RNA-seq reads (third track) on human Chromosome 11 in MDAMB-231 cells. Red-highlighted are hit RNAs from the two long non-coding RNA genes NEAT1 and MALAT1. Black-highlighted are non-hit RNAs from protein-coding FOSL1 and PACS1 genes. Grey indicates collective reads from all other non-hit RNAs in this region (fifth track). Note that FOSL1 was expressed at a higher level than NEAT1 and MALAT1 based on the RNAseq data (third track), indicating that hit RNAs are not necessarily from highly expressed genes. Boxed regions are enlarged in bottom panels to further show the GRID-seq detected RNA signals of hit RNA of MALAT1 and non-hit RNA of PACS1 on DNA in comparison with gene expression.

Extended Data Fig. 9 | RNA-chromatin interactions on cell type-specific enhancers a, b, Scatter plots of background (a) and foreground (b) GRIP-seq signals between MDA-MD231 and MM.1S cells in the 1 Kb-binned human genome. c, d, Violin plots showing coenrichment of specific RNA-chromatin interactions and key chromatin marks in MDA-MB-231 cells (c) and MM.1S (d). Left: Enrichment of mean chromatin interaction signals of hit RNAs relative to ChIP-seq peaks of RNA Pol II, H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 (all based on the published ChIP-seq data, see Extended Methods). Right: Background signals. Bars represent the range from 25 to 75 percentile. e, f, Quantification of mean hit RNA densities on enhancers in the same cell type (orange) relative to specific enhancers in a different cell type (grey). g, Superenhancers relative to RNA-chromatin interactions signals detected by GRID-seq. Enhancers in MDA-MD-231 cells were defined based on the mapped H3K27ac signals (from the data in GSM1204474 and GSM1204475). Each red bar on top represents a super-enhancer. Red line: The cumulative curve of rank-ordered RNA-chromatin interactions; Grey dashed line: Random distribution. h, Probability density map of hit RNA coverage on super-enhancers (SE, red) versus typical enhancers (TE, blue). i, Left: Rank-ordered RNA-chromatin interaction levels on all active enhancers. Right: Upper (SE enriched) and lower (TE enriched) 10 percentiles of enhancers selected for functional analysis. j, Expression of genes associated with top 10% RNAinteracting enhancers (red box) relative to those associated with bottom 10% RNA-interacting enhancers (green box), both within the ±50 Kb range based on the GRO-seq assay performed on the same cell type. k, Fold changes in GRO-seq plotted in the accumulative fashion for the two groups of genes as defined in c in response to functional perturbation of enhancers on MDAMD-231 cells by using the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1. estimated by t-test in panel h, j and k.

Extended Data Fig. 10 | Inferred enhancer-promoter distance and example a, Densities of hit RNA signals on typical and super-enhancers in MM.1S cells. x-axis: Z-scores of all trans-chromosomal RNA signals (teal). Z ≥ 3 was set to define significant RNA coverage on enhancers. b, Distribution of linear DNA distance between super-enhancers and genes. c, Distribution of linear DNA distance between typical enhancers and genes. The data indicate similar ranges reached out by typical and super-enhancers. d, A Circos plot, showing a representative case of two hit RNAs from two genes RRBP1 and SNX5 on nearby seven enhancers, one of which corresponds to a super-enhancer in MM.1S cells. The RRBP1 RNA binding profile is shown on the outer track (green) and the SNX5 RNA binding profile on the inter track (blue). Ribbons connecting with enhancers illustrate inferred enhancer-promoter interactions. e, f, Upon JQ1 treatment, fold changes in gene expression are shown in e (based on the data from GSM1094100, GSM1094101, GSM1094092 and GSM1094093) and fold changes in BRD4 binding on individual enhancers in f (based on the data from GSM1038271 and GSM1038275).
