SUMMARY

The ability to sequence genomes has far outstripped approaches for deciphering the information they encode. Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome proﬁling (the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to deﬁne protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. We also deﬁne a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity to mammalian proteomes.
INTRODUCTION In the 10 years since the publication of draft human genomes (Lander et al., 2001; Venter et al., 2001), extraordinary advances in DNA sequencing technology (Bentley et al., 2008) have made it possible to obtain comprehensive genomic information rapidly and at low cost. Decoding the information contained in these genomes represents a central challenge for the biological community. Protein-coding regions have been deﬁned according to simple rules about the nature of translation—for example, that open reading frames (ORFs) have a minimum length, have biased codon usage, and start at the ﬁrst AUG in a transcript

(Brent, 2005). Yet there are many exceptions to these rules, including internal ribosome entry sites, initiation at non-AUG codons, leaky scanning, translational reinitiation, and translational frameshifts (Atkins and Gesteland, 2010). Additionally, an abundant class of large intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) that do not contain canonical ORFs has been recently been described (Guttman et al., 2009, 2010). Many of these lincRNA transcripts are likely to be functional RNAs, but there are welldocumented cases of biologically important short coding regions. For example, the Drosophila tarsal-less/polished rice gene was originally thought to be a lincRNA (Tupy et al., 2005) but actually encodes a series of short peptides that modulate the activity of the shavenbaby transcription factor (Kondo et al., 2010). The question of which of the potential lincRNAs are actually translated remains largely unaddressed. We also know that the rate of translation is not constant across a message, and translation pauses can regulate synthesis (Darnell et al., 2011; Morris and Geballe, 2000), folding (Kimchi-Sarfaty et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2009), and localization of a protein (Mariappan et al., 2010) or mRNA (Yanagitani et al., 2011). These pauses can results from codon usage (Irwin et al., 1995), mRNA structure (Namy et al., 2006), or peptide sequence (Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002; Tenson and Ehrenberg, 2002), but little information exists on how generally they occur, let alone their functional impact. Recently, we described a strategy, termed ribosome proﬁling, based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, that makes it possible to monitor translation with a depth, speed, and accuracy that rival existing approaches for following mRNA levels (Guo et al., 2010; Ingolia et al., 2009). By revealing the precise locations of ribosomes on each mRNA, ribosome proﬁling also has the potential to identify protein-coding regions. However, initiation from multiple sites within a single transcript makes it challenging to deﬁne all ORFs, especially in complex transcriptomes. Additionally, ribosome proﬁling provides a snapshot of ribosome positions but does not report directly on the kinetics of translational elongation or distinguish stalled ribosomes from those engaged in active elongation. Here we describe a simpliﬁed, robust protocol for ribosome proﬁling in mammalian systems. We have used this technique to determine the kinetics of translation by following run-off

elongation after stalling new initiation using the drug harringtonine (Fresno et al., 1977; Huang, 1975; Robert et al., 2009; Tscherne and Pestka, 1975). We further employ harringtonine, which causes ribosomes to accumulate precisely at initiation codons, together with a machine learning algorithm, to deﬁne the sites of translation initiation genome-wide. Application of our approach to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) reveals a wide range of unannotated or modiﬁed ORFs, including highly translated short ORFs in the majority of annotated lincRNAs. We now classify these atypical protein-coding transcripts as short, polycistronic ribosome-associated RNAs (sprcRNAs). Additionally, we identify over a thousand strong translational pauses that could act as key regulatory sites. Our approach is readily applicable to other cells and organisms and as such provides a general scheme for decoding complex genomes, monitoring rates of protein production, and exploring the molecular mechanisms used to regulate translation. RESULTS A Simpliﬁed Mammalian Ribosome-Proﬁling Assay We ﬁrst describe a simpliﬁed ribosome-proﬁling strategy suitable for the analysis of mammalian cells. In general terms, the assay involves three distinct steps, each of which has been reﬁned: (1) generation of cell extracts in which ribosomes have been faithfully halted along the mRNA they are translating in vivo; (2) nuclease digestion of RNAs that are not protected by the ribosome followed by recovery of the ribosome-protected mRNA fragments; (3) quantitative conversion of the protected RNA fragments into a DNA library that can be analyzed by deep sequencing (Ingolia, 2010; Ingolia et al., 2009; Lau et al., 2001; Pfeffer et al., 2005). After nuclease treatment, we puriﬁed ribosomes and the associated mRNA footprints by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion rather than by sucrose density gradient fractionation, which is a more specialized technique. Protected mRNA fragments from single ribosomes were puriﬁed by PAGE, as fragments that derive from other ribosomal complexes are longer—tightly packed ribosome pairs protect 58–62 nt of mRNA (Wolin and Walter, 1988), and 48S preinitiation complexes are reported to protect 50 nt or 70 nt under different conditions (Lazarowitz and Robertson, 1977; Pisarev et al., 2008; Ule et al., 2003; Chi et al., 2009; Lunde et al., 2007). We generated libraries from these puriﬁed fragments using our previous published protocol (Ingolia, 2010; Ingolia et al., 2009), modiﬁed to use RNA ligation to attach a linker to the 30 end of the protected RNA fragment (Lau et al., 2001; Pfeffer et al., 2005). Additionally, we used subtractive hybridization to substantially deplete the majority of contaminating ribosomal RNA fragments. We explored the effects of stabilizing ribosome-mRNA interactions with elongation inhibitors before cell lysis. We compared cycloheximide (Schneider-Poetsch et al., 2010) and emetine pretreatment to a ‘‘no drug’’ approach in which unperturbed cells were lysed in a buffer that should not support continued elongation. The density of ribosome footprints on each coding sequence (CDS), which measures the translation of the gene, agreed well across the three approaches (cycloheximide versus no drug, standard deviation (SD) of log2 ratio 0.20, corresponding to a typical 15% inter-replicate difference; cycloheximide

versus emetine, SD log2 ratio 0.40; emetine versus no drug, SD log2 ratio 0.41) (Figure 1A). We concluded that brief treatment of cells with elongation inhibitors did not signiﬁcantly change which transcripts were associated with ribosomes and did not distort translation measurements made by ribosome proﬁling. Thus, pretreatment can be chosen based on experimental constraints. For example, elongation inhibitors would preserve the cellular state of translation during manipulations such as ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), whereas ﬂashfreezing and cryogenic lysis would enable the analysis of tissues where infusion of translation inhibitors is challenging. Nonetheless, elongation inhibitors do alter the pattern of ribosome footprints along transcripts. Footprints derived from emetine-treated cells are slightly longer than those from untreated or cycloheximide-treated cells (Figure 1B and Figures S1A and S1B available online), suggesting that emetine stabilizes a different ribosome conformation that protects more mRNA. Furthermore, a metagene analysis, in which many gene proﬁles are aligned and then averaged, revealed global differences in ribosome density at the beginning and ends of ORFs. The excess of ribosomes at the initiation site and extending over the ﬁrst 5 to 10 codons is essentially absent from untreated cells (Figure 1C). Such an excess would result from the inhibition of translation elongation in the presence of continuing initiation. Beyond the initial 5 to 10 codon window, we saw no global variation in ribosome density along CDSes in any sample. An earlier analysis had suggested that the excess ribosomes extending over $100 codons at the beginning of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORFs reﬂected a broadly conserved ‘‘ramping’’ strategy that minimized ribosome stacking and collisions later in the messages (Tuller et al., 2010). Although it is possible that such a ramping effect occurs in S. cerevisiae, it does not appear to occur mammalian cells. Drug pretreatment also eliminates the excess of ribosomes seen at the stop codon in untreated cells (Figure 1D). The accumulation is still seen when cells are lysed in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, suggesting that it does not result from continued elongation in the lysate (N. Stern-Ginossar and J.S.W., unpublished data). Interestingly, we saw longer footprints at stop codons (Figures 1B and S1B), suggesting that the accumulating ribosomes are in a different conformation, as has been seen during termination in vitro (Alkalaeva et al., 2006). In summary, although drug pretreatment does not distort measurements of the overall level of translation of a given message (Figure 1A), caution should be used in interpreting position-speciﬁc information. We characterized translation in an mESC line (E14 mESCs), with matched ribosome-proﬁling and mRNA-seq data. We used ribosome footprint density within a CDS as a measure of protein synthesis and determined levels of gene expression genome-wide (Figure S1C and Tables S1A and S1B). We also compared protein synthesis with mRNA abundance and showed that there was a broad distribution encompassing over a 10-fold range in the amount of protein produced per transcript (Figure S1D and Tables S1C and S1D). This distribution is asymmetric, suggesting a maximal rate of protein production from an mRNA and substantial dynamic range for decreased translational efﬁciency. Our data are consistent

with recent work that indirectly infers translation levels from absolute mRNA and protein abundance measurements (Schwan¨ hausser et al., 2011). Notably, they found that translation was the single largest contributor to protein abundance, highlighting the value of direct measurements of protein synthesis. Widespread Presence of Strong Ribosomal Pauses The density of ribosome footprint reads varies substantially at different codons within an individual message (Figure 2A). The footprint count on a codon should be proportional to the average ribosome dwell time there, so this density variation represents differences in the speed of the ribosome. Position-speciﬁc variability is pervasive in both yeast and mESC ribosome-proﬁling data (Ingolia et al., 2009), but in mammalian translation, we ﬁnd more pronounced pauses where ribosome density is 25-fold or greater than the median density observed across the body of the gene. Based on a typical elongation rate of $6 codons per second (see below), the pauses we see last for several

seconds (Figure 2A), which is enough time for the paused ribosome-nascent chain (RNC) complex to bind cotranslational chaperones. We ﬁnd thousands of pauses in the body of genes (1500 pauses in 1100 genes found in a set of 4994 well-expressed genes; Tables S2A and S2B) and at termination codons (420 pauses; Table S2C). Interestingly, we see no evidence that pausing causes secondary ribosome accumulation $10 codons upstream, where a following ribosome would collide with the stalled one (Wolin and Walter, 1988), nor a depletion of ribosomes within the 10 codon ‘‘shadow’’ resulting from paused ribosomes (Figure 2B). The lack of packed ribosomes at pause sites suggests that ribosome density is typically too low to cause frequent encounters between upstream elongating ribosomes and a transiently stalled downstream ribosome (Arava et al., 2003). Alternately, such a collision might relieve ribosomal stalling, allowing for the continual presence of a ribosome at a pause site while minimizing ribosome sequestration.

The absence of downstream depletion also argues that the majority of ribosomes continue elongation following these pause sites. Analysis of the sequence around the pause sites reveals a consensus peptide motif (Figure 2C). There is strong enrichment of glutamate or asparate in the A site at strong pauses, preceded by a proline or glycine and then another proline, with an additional bias toward the GAA glutamate codon and CC(A/T) proline codons. Importantly, we see no enrichment for residues or codons downstream of the A site, which are not yet being decoded. We also see no evidence that the pause sites are enriched for rare codons. Sites that match the full three-residue consensus have dramatically reduced elongation rates overall (Figure 2D). Translation in E. coli is stalled by similar peptide motifs with a terminal Pro-Pro peptide, in some cases with an Asp codon in the A site (Tanner et al., 2009). Our ﬁndings suggest that transfer RNA (tRNA) identity and nascent peptide sequence can inﬂuence the kinetics of elongation, whereas even for rare codons, tRNA recruitment is not rate limiting. Our analysis also provides insights into the limited number of previously documented translational pauses. A recent study observed slow termination of two tail-anchored (TA) proteins (Sec61b and Vamp) during in vitro translation (Mariappan et al., 2010). Pausing at the termination codon of TA proteins has
792 Cell 147, 789–802, November 11, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.

been proposed to provide time for the recruitment of the insertion machinery before the release of the C-terminal transmembrane domain from the ribosome exit channel. Our data conﬁrmed termination pausing during the Sec61b and Vamp translation in vivo (Figure 2E), but we found no evidence for this phenomenon in the majority of other TA proteins (3/32 have pauses), nor was it restricted to TA proteins (stop codon ribosome density does not differ signiﬁcantly, Kruskal-Wallis p $0.25). Instead, pausing at termination codons is a common feature of translation. A second prominent example of a translation pause follows a hydrophobic sequence in the Xbp1 transcription factor (Yanagitani et al., 2011). This hydrophobic domain interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and recruits the Xbp1 message RNC complex (Yanagitani et al., 2009). Ribosome pausing facilitates this cotranslational localization by delaying the dissociation of the RNC. We conﬁrmed the presence of this pause and identiﬁed its precise position as residue Asn256, which is the last codon required for translational arrest (Yanagitani et al., 2011) (Figure 2F). The biological roles of the pauses we identify remain to be established, but many mRNAs are localized to speciﬁc subcellular regions (Martin and Ephrussi, 2009), including a number of mRNAs found on the ER surface that, like Xbp1, do not enter the secretory pathway (Kraut-Cohen

Although this may be the case for speciﬁc examples, we ﬁnd Monitoring Kinetics of Translation no evidence for a large effect on the overall rate of elongation.

We reasoned that we could monitor the kinetics of provides a reliable measure of protein synthesis independent in vivo translation directly by tracing run-off elongation using of the particular gene being translated. ribosome proﬁling. We ﬁrst stopped new translation using harringtonine, which effectively blocks initiation by inhibiting Deﬁning Translation Start Sites elongation during the ﬁrst rounds of peptide bond formation We found that harringtonine treatment also leads to a profound following subunit joining (Fresno et al., 1977; Robert et al., accumulation of ribosomes at the sites of translation initiation 2009). We then allowed a short time for run-off elongation before (Figures 4A and 4B). This effect likely occurs because harringtoadding cycloheximide to halt translation by all active ribo- nine binds to free 60S subunits but not those that are joined somes. We varied the time allowed for run-off elongation to into an 80S ribosome. Thus, elongating ribosomes are immune generate a series of snapshots that could be assembled into to harringtonine, whereas a 60S subunit bound by harringtonine a moving picture of translation in vivo (Figure 3A). Metagene will form an 80S at a start site that does not move forward analyses revealed a progressive depletion of ribosomes from (Fresno et al., 1977; Robert et al., 2009).

Accordingly, we the time required for engagement of harringtonine, ribosomes used a support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning progress from the 50 ends of transcripts at a rate of 5.6 amino strategy (Joachims, 1999; Noble, 2006) to comprehensively acids per second (Figures 3B and 3C), which is consistent identify initiation sites from harringtonine-treated ribosome ¨ with values from previous single-gene measurements (Bostrom footprint proﬁles, using a ‘‘vector’’ of footprint counts around a candidate translation start site. The SVM model was trained et al., 1986).

on a set of annotated genes to identify features of footprint proﬁles that distinguish the start codon from other positions. These proﬁles capture not just the accumulation of ribosomes at the start codon but also the distinctive asymmetric pattern of reads across ﬂanking codons. Analysis of a distinct testing set of transcripts not used for training established that this model recognized 86% of annotated start codons as sites of translation initiation in comparison to only $1% of other positions (Figures 4C and S2A). Actual false-negative and falsepositive rates may be considerably lower, as not all annotated start sites are correct and there is a substantial rate of translation initiation from noncanonical start sites. We applied the SVM approach to identify 13,454 candidate translation start sites within $5000 transcripts that were wellexpressed in our mESCs (Table S2A). The majority (65%) of these transcripts contain more than one detectable site of translation initiation, with 16% containing four or more sites (Figure 4D and Table S3). Although the analysis examined all potential translation start sites, we observed a dramatic enrichment for AUG (23-fold; Figure 4E), which provides an independent line of evidence for the accuracy of the SVM approach. We also found a strong enrichment for a speciﬁc subset of the near-cognate codons (i.e., codons that differ from AUG by a single nucleotide) at initiation sites (Figure 4E). Initiation at near-cognate sites is sometimes resistant to harringtonine (Starck et al., 2008; N. Stern-Ginossar and J.S.W., unpublished data), so our analysis may underestimate the true prevalence of near-cognate initiation. Characterization of Alternate Open Reading Frames We classiﬁed the reading frames downstream of the initiation sites we identiﬁed based on their relationship to the annotated ORF (Figure 4F). Nearly half (44%) of the AUG initiation sites that we found are unannotated, and the majority of these were downstream of the annotated start and were predicted to produce N-terminally truncated proteins or ORFs encoded in alternate reading frames (Figure S2B). In many cases, the annotated AUG was also used, and the alternate protein may not be the primary translation product. However, 280 of the genes with N-terminal truncations lacked detectable initiation on the annotated AUG, either because the annotated start codon is skipped in favor of the internal start site that we identiﬁed, or because the transcript is truncated and the annotated start codon is absent. A substantial fraction (14%) of the initiation sites we observed are predicted to produce alternate protein isoforms of known genes (Figure 4F). We identiﬁed 570 genes with potential N-terminal extensions and 870 with N-terminal truncations in the 4,994 genes we analyzed. Extensions most often resulted from near-cognate initiation (Figure S2B), probably because computational gene annotation selects the ﬁrst in-frame AUG, though conservation has been used to identify N-terminal extensions from near-cognate initiation (Ivanov et al., 2011). We found an N-terminal extension on the DNA repair protein Swi5 (Figure 4G); its protein sequence is conserved, and there is experimental evidence that endogenous mouse Swi5 is larger than the annotated 89 amino acid protein (Akamatsu and Jasin, 2010). Our data also revealed information about the protein

products resulting from alternative splicing, which are often difﬁcult to annotate. For instance, the growth factor Igf2 has two 50 untranslated region (UTR) variants with the same reading frame annotated in both transcripts, but we observed an isoform-speciﬁc N-terminal extension (Figure S2C). The N-terminal truncations are of particular note as they can produce functionally distinct protein isoforms that lack an entire amino-terminal domain. For example, alternate start codons in the Cebpa gene can result in either a full-length transcription factor or a truncated dominant-negative isoform that contains the DNA-binding domain but not the full transactivation domain (Lin et al., 1993). We observe clear evidence of additional N-terminal truncations that could produce similar antagonistic products. Internal initiation in the Ets family transcription factor Etv5 produces a product that lacks the predicted activation ´ domain (Monte et al., 1996) but contains the domain that medi´ ates DNA binding (Monte et al., 1994) (Figure S2D). This mechanism is not limited to transcription factors—internal initiation in the signaling scaffold Ecsit produces a protein nearly identical to a dominant-negative form created by designed N-terminal deletion (Figure 4H) (Kopp et al., 1999). Exploring Translation of sprcRNAs The above analysis focuses on known coding transcripts, but recently an abundant class of RNAs, referred to as lincRNAs, have been identiﬁed that lack the characteristics of conventional protein-coding genes. A limited number of lincRNAs such as Xist and HotAir have been shown to act at the RNA level in the nucleus (Brockdorff et al., 1992; Khalil et al., 2009), but the extent to which putative lincRNAs are translated is not known. Accordingly, we searched for translated regions within candidate lincRNAs (Guttman et al., 2009, 2010) by ﬁnding the most highly ribosome-occupied 90 nt window within the lincRNA and determining its translational efﬁciency as the ratio of ribosome footprint and mRNA-seq reads (Guttman et al., 2010, 2009). This analysis was very effective at distinguishing between traditional translated CDSes and their 30 UTRs, which are poorly translated (Figure 5A). Remarkably, the majority of putative lincRNAs contain regions of high translation comparable to protein-coding genes (Figure 5A and Table S4). We saw speciﬁc start sites marked by harringtonine followed by ribosome footprints extending to the ﬁrst in-frame stop codon (Figures 5B–5D) (Clemson et al., 2009). These data establish that the majority of lincRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm and effectively engaged by the protein translation machinery. These included roughly half of the lincRNA candidates that were recently shown to be required for maintenance of pluripotency (Guttman et al., 2011). We classify these RNAs as sprcRNAs based on our observation that they contain small CDSes that are bound by elongating ribosomes and frequently contain multiple ORFs. We also identify a signiﬁcant subset of true lincRNAs that are not translated, including the well-documented RNA element NEAT1, which regulates mRNA export (Clemson et al., 2009). The extent to which various RNAs act through their translation products and/or directly through their transcript remains a central open question that our dataset should provide a critical resource for addressing.

(A) Translational efﬁciency of putative lincRNAs. The translational efﬁciency, a normalized ratio of ribosome footprint density to mRNA-seq read density, is plotted for the most highly occupied 90 nt window of each lincRNA, protein-coding gene, and coding transcript 30 UTR, along with a histogram of translational efﬁciency values for CDSes and 30 UTRs and the median and quartile values for protein-coding genes. (B) Ribosome footprint proﬁle of the uc009lvh.1 transcript. This RNA is annotated as a noncoding RNA, but we identify two short (25 and 54 amino acids) well-translated ORFs and see little translation from a longer (81 amino acid) downstream CDS hypothesized to encode a protein (Hassan et al., 2010). (C) Ribosome footprint proﬁle of the 2610001J05Rik genomic locus. The proﬁle includes transcript-aligned reads mapped to corresponding genomic positions and genomic-aligned reads with no transcript alignment. The annotated noncoding uc009ayt.1 transcript is shown along with the reconstructed transcript (Guttman et al., 2010). (D) Ribosome footprint proﬁle of the uc009ayt.1 transcript. See also Table S4.

Widespread Translation of uORFs The majority of unannotated near-cognate initiation sites we detected drive the translation of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) (Figures 6A and S4B). This is consistent with the high level of translation that we observe on many 50 UTRs as opposed to 30 UTRs, which are almost devoid of ribosomes. These uORF initiation sites are accompanied by elongating ribosome footprints in the untreated sample that are depleted during harringtonine treatment, indicating that they are involved in active translation (Figure 4B). In a few well-studied examples, uORFs have been shown to affect translation of downstream genes. The ﬁrst uORF in the Atf4 transcript is constitutively translated, and ribosomes then reinitiate at either the second uORF or the CDS (Calvo et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2004; Morris and Geballe, 2000) (Figure 6B). This exempliﬁes two roles of uORFs—some permit downstream reinitiation, whereas others capture some fraction of scanning preinitiation complexes and decrease CDS translation. There are a small number of well-documented uORFs with near-cognate start codons (Ivanov et al., 2008), but there are no effective computational approaches for identifying them. Our observations suggest that near-cognate uORFs are quite common. The ribosome footprint proﬁles of Myc and Nanog, two genes that play a

critical role in pluripotency, illustrate the complexity of translation; both have multiple uORFs and alternate translation products initiating at both AUG and near-cognate sites (Figures 6C and 6D). Due to the prevalence of alternative transcription start sites and alternative splicing, many genes have multiple 50 UTR isoforms, potentially including distinct regulatory information (Hughes, 2006). Many initiation sites occurred in alternative UTRs; we found 1,800 genes showing differential initiation of uORFs in distinct 50 UTR isoforms. We additionally observed that at least 30% of these genes showed a signiﬁcant difference in the ratio of ribosome footprint to mRNA-seq reads between the distinct 50 UTRs of different isoforms. Thus, alternative splicing generates transcripts with different upstream initiation sites and results in different uORF translation. For example, the transcription factor Atf5 is regulated by well-characterized uORFs in one mRNA isoform that are missing from a less-abundant isoform expressed in early development (Hansen et al., 2002). We observe robust translation initiation at a distinct uORF in this second isoform (Figure 6E). Alternative inclusion of uORFs was also seen in ribosomal proteins, including Rps27a, where a small fraction of transcripts had a retained 50 UTR intron that introduced a uORF (Figure 6F).

Figure 7. Changes in Upstream Translation during Differentiation
(A) Translational regulation following LIF withdrawal. The distribution of log2 fold-changes of translational efﬁciency (ratio of sample-normalized ribosome footprint density to mRNA-seq density) is shown for all genes and for those with the GO annotation ‘‘structural constituent of ribosome’’ (see Table S5D). Inset: distributions for all genes, 36 hr and 8 days after LIF withdrawal (see Tables S5A and S5D). (B) Changes in relative upstream translation in EBs versus ESCs. The ratio of footprints between the 50 UTR and the ORF was computed for each gene, and the distribution of log2 change in the 50 UTR/ORF ratio is plotted, with decreases in EB shown in blue and increases in EB shown in yellow. (C and D) Patterns of translation on the Ccnb5 (C) and Anapc5 (D) transcripts. Ribosome footprints that map to the 50 UTR are in dark colors, and the CDS in faint colors. The average, sample-normalized ribosome footprint density on the CDS is slightly higher in the EB sample than in the ESC sample for both. See also Figure S4 and Table S5.

case of isoforms where an alternative UTR splice junction is quite close to the shared start codon, ribosome footprints from initiation at the start codon can include enough distinct upstream sequence to distinguish the effect of different UTRs. The gene Pih1d1 has two 50 UTR variants with distinct uORFs. Strong initiation of the uORF in one isoform led to 50% less initiation of its protein-coding reading frame as compared to initiation of the same protein-coding reading frame in the second isoform (Figure S3). This effect demonstrates the potential impact of the widespread upstream initiation we observe in both alternative and constitutive 50 UTRs. Changes in Translation during Embryoid Body Formation We next asked how the landscape of translation changes when proliferative, pluripotent ESCs undergo differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs). Withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induced differentiation (Figure S4A), which we assessed visually and by the downregulation of the direct LIF target Klf4 (Niwa et al., 2009), followed by loss of Oct4 expression and the induction of developmental and lineage-speciﬁc genes (Figures S4B and S4C and Tables S5A–S5F). We then looked for translational control of gene expression during differentiation and observed strong repression of ribosomal proteins (RPs) in EBs relative to ESCs (Figures 7A and S4D and Table S5F). Although these genes were still highly expressed in EBs, they were

translated 3- to 4-fold less efﬁciently than the typical transcript (Tables S5D–S5F). The translation of RPs is regulated in response to proliferation and nutrient status (Hamilton et al., 2006), and here we show that this response is a notable feature of EB formation. Polysome-proﬁling experiments have suggested a global increase in cellular translation during early ESC differentiation, and we see a modest upregulation of RPs in our early time point (Sampath et al., 2008). This might lead to a surfeit of ribosomes at the later stage of EB formation. Intriguingly, Akt/mTOR signaling controls RP expression and may regulate translation during differentiation more generally (Di Cristofano et al., 1998; Sampath et al., 2008). We also observed a modest but quite signiﬁcant increase in the translational efﬁciency of integral membrane proteins in EBs (Figure S4E and Table S5F), which could result directly from a redirection of ribosomes to the rough ER, or indirectly through regulatory programs whose targets are enriched for membrane proteins. Translation of uORFs also declined substantially during differentiation. We measured the level of upstream translation using the ratio of ribosome footprint reads in the 50 UTR to the CDS of each gene and found that the typical transcript showed an $25% decrease in 50 UTR translation during differentiation (Figure 7B). This shift can be observed on the 50 UTR of individual genes with deﬁned uORFs (Figures 7C and 7D). It reﬂects a broad change in the translational apparatus with the potential to impact gene expression genome-wide. Reduced upstream

translation might reﬂect a relative decrease in cap-dependent versus cap-independent initiation, as cap-dependent initiation would be expected to favor upstream sites near the cap. Such a shift has been associated with proliferation in tumorigenesis and has been linked to the translational control of RPs (Mamane et al., 2006; Ruggero and Sonenberg, 2005). This tumor cell translational program may also be active in ESCs. DISCUSSION Here we present a range of ribosome-proﬁling techniques, based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments, that dramatically expand our ability to deﬁne and quantitatively monitor mammalian proteomes. Our approaches provide experimentally based maps of the protein-coding potential of complex genomes and reveal in-depth information about the kinetics and mechanism of translation elongation and coupled cotranslational events. Finally, ribosome proﬁling allows high-precision, genome-wide measures of the rate of protein synthesis from the density of ribosome footprints, much as RNA-seq experiments measure mRNA abundance from read density; such gene expression measurements may represent the most frequent application of ribosome proﬁling even after the proteome is fully deﬁned. Although there have been remarkable advances in quantitative mass spectrometry (Nilsson et al., 2010), it is difﬁcult to match the large dynamic range and comprehensive nature of deep sequencing. More generally mass spectrometry and ribosome proﬁling represent highly complementary approaches; for example, comparison between changes in rate of synthesis measured by ribosome proﬁling and abundance measured by mass spectrometry should reveal examples of regulated degradation of proteins. A number of features of mammalian proteomes emerge from our studies, including the ubiquitous use of alternate initiation sites that drive the production of extended or truncated isoforms of known proteins as well as the translation of sprcRNAs, whose protein-coding potential was not initially apparent. We also observe widespread translation upstream of mammalian protein-coding genes, similar to but more extensive than upstream translation that we observed in yeast (Ingolia et al., 2009). Translation of uORFs can modulate the expression of the downstream protein-coding gene in response to global (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009) or gene-speciﬁc regulatory signals (Medenbach et al., 2011). We have shown that upstream translation decreases as ESCs undergo differentiation, indicating that it is subject to regulation and may be part of a major program of translational control. Our studies also establish that many sites of translation initiation, especially upstream initiation, occur at non-AUG codons. Although most productive protein synthesis starts at a classical AUG codon, initiation at CUG and GUG codons is widespread and is likely to have broad biological signiﬁcance. An important open question is how this non-AUG initiation differs mechanistically from AUG initiation and what factors regulate initiation site selection. The bias toward upstream non-AUG initiation seems to conﬂict with a pure scanning model for start codon recognition, as a preinitiation complex that bypasses the annotated AUG is no less likely to recognize a subsequent

CUG, though the difference could reﬂect heterogeneous stringencies in scanning complexes. Non-AUG initiation clearly impacts many aspects of translation. The extensive upstream non-AUG initiation we observe is likely to regulate protein synthesis from speciﬁc transcripts in response to global changes in initiation. It is also regulated during EB formation, suggesting a global link with growth and proliferation, and is involved in the synthesis of functional proteins, including the well-studied oncogene and pluripotency factor Myc (Hann et al., 1988). More broadly, it has been implicated in the production of peptides for immune surveillance (Malarkannan et al., 1999), and additional roles will likely emerge as we understand more about which non-AUG codons are used and how this selection is regulated.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Ribosome Footprinting E14 mESCs were propagated in standard culture feeder-free conditions (Tremml et al., 2008), and differentiation was induced by transferring cells to media lacking LIF in low-adhesion dishes. Cells were pretreated with harringtonine (2 mg/ml), cycloheximide (100 mg/ml), and/or emetine (20 mg/ml) as indicated, and detergent lysis was performed in the dish. The lysate was DNase-treated and clariﬁed, and a sample was taken for mRNA-Seq analysis. Lysates were subject to ribosome footprinting by nuclease treatment. Footprint fragments were puriﬁed, and deep sequencing libraries were generated from these fragments, as well as from poly(A) mRNA puriﬁed from untreated lysate. These libraries were analyzed by sequencing on the Illumina GAII and HiSeq. Footprint Sequence Alignment Sequences were aligned to a library of transcripts derived from the UCSC Known Genes data set (Hsu et al., 2006) and the reconstructed mESC transcriptome of Guttman et al. (Guttman et al., 2010), and those with no acceptable transcript alignment were then aligned against the genome. Because sequencing reads comprise a variable-length RNA fragment followed by a linker sequence, the ﬁrst 26 nucleotides were aligned against the reference database using Bowtie, and this alignment was extended until it reached the known linker sequence. Alignments were accepted with up to two mismatches, and multiple alignments were allowed for a single sequence, but alignments with fewer mismatches were preferred. For most analyses, footprint alignments were assigned to speciﬁc A site nucleotides by using the position and total length of each alignment, calibrated from footprints at the beginning and the end of CDSes (Figures S1A and S1B) as previously described (Ingolia et al., 2009). Footprint Proﬁle Analysis Proﬁles of ribosome footprints across a transcript were constructed by quantifying the number of footprints assigned to each nucleotide position. A set of well-expressed genes was selected based on median footprint density across the CDS, excluding the ﬁrst 15 and last 5 codons due to the accumulation of ribosomes (Figures 1C and 1D). To construct metagene density proﬁles, individual gene proﬁles were scaled by their footprint density in the untreated control, and all were averaged with equal weight. Harringtonine Depletion Proﬁle Analysis Metagene proﬁles from harringtonine run-off were further normalized by the median value over codons 800–1000, which appeared undepleted at harringtonine treatment times used in this study, and smoothed by averaging disjoint 5 codon windows. The extent of depletion was deﬁned as the earliest codon position, beyond the ﬁrst 40, that retained at least 50% of the full ribosome density. Subsets of genes for elongation rate analysis were as follows: (1) lowest and highest quintile of tAI, computed according to dos Reis et al. (2004); (2) lowest and highest quintile of ribosome footprint density; (3) short

genes, 750–1,000 codons, and long genes, over 1,000 codons; (4) secreted proteins that were identiﬁed using SignalP data from Ensembl. Initiation Site Prediction Initiation site predictions for each nucleotide position were based on a vector of footprint read counts over 15 codons around the position for each harringtonine sample, concatenated to produce an overall vector. The SVMlight pattern-recognition tool (Joachims, 1999) was trained on an arbitrary set of 3,200 transcripts, using the annotated start codon as a positive example and ten other positions as negative examples. Initiation sites were deﬁned as one or more consecutive nucleotide positions that passed an SVM score threshold as well as a minimum of 50 harringtonine footprints total among all samples. These consecutive blocks were typically (91%) three or fewer nucleotides long and in no case longer than six nucleotides (Table S3). Initiation sites that contained an AUG codon were assigned to that codon or, if none was present, to any near-cognate codons, and the reading frame was predicted from that codon. Sites with no recognizable initiation codon or with multiple potential near-cognate codons could not be assigned to a speciﬁc reading frame and were eliminated from further analyses. The preferential assignment of initiation sites to AUG codons may lead to a modest bias against detecting near-cognate initiation. lincRNA Analysis lincRNAs were collected from reconstructed transcripts (Guttman et al., 2010) that lay entirely within the lincRNA chromatin signatures identiﬁed by Guttman et al. (2009), which excluded known protein-coding genes. Footprint density proﬁles from the untreated sample were analyzed to identify the 90 nt window with the most positions occupied by at least one ribosome footprint among all transcripts in the chromatin region. For annotated protein-coding transcripts, the CDS and the 30 UTR were analyzed separately. The mRNA abundance was calculated as the density of mRNA-seq reads in the window, and the translational efﬁciency was calculated as the ratio between the ribosome footprint and the mRNA-seq read density in the window.

Supplemental Information
EXTENDED EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture and Drug Treatment E14 mESCs were plated on 15 cm dishes coated with gelatin (0.1% in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium salts) and grown in GMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, glutamine, pyruvate, b-mercaptoethanol, and leukemia inhibitory factor (Tremml et al., 2008). Harringtonine (LKT Laboratories) treatment was performed by adding the drug to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 mg/ml from a 2 mg/ml stock in DMSO. Cells were returned to 37 C following drug addition. Cycloheximide (Sigma) treatment was performed by adding the drug to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 mg/ml from a 50 mg/ml stock in 100 percent EtOH. Cells were returned to 37 C for 1 min following drug addition. Emetine (Sigma) treatment was performed in a similar manner, adding the drug to a ﬁnal concentration of 20 mg/ml from a 100 mg/ml stock in DMSO. Lysis Medium was aspirated from dishes, which were immediately placed on ice and rinsed with 10 ml ice-cold PBS supplemented with drugs used in pretreatment of the cells. PBS was aspirated and 800 ml ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of polysome buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol) supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 24 U / ml Turbo DNase (Ambion, AM2239), along with any drugs used for sample treatment) was dripped onto dishes. Cells were scraped extensively and triturated through a pipette. The lysate was removed and incubated 10 min on ice with periodic agitation. The lysate was then clariﬁed by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 3 g, 4 C and $1.1 ml supernatant was recovered. Ribosome Footprinting A 600 ml aliquot of lysate was treated with 15 ml RNase I 100 U/ml (Ambion, AM2295) for 45 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 30 ml SuperaseIn 20 U/ml (Ambion, AM2696). Digestions were then immediately loaded onto a 1 M sucrose cushion, prepared in polysome buffer containing 0.1 U/ml SuperaseIn. Ribosomes were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 hr at 70,000 rpm, 4 C in a TLA-110 rotor. The liquid was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 570 ml 10 mM Tris (pH 7), followed by the immediate addition of 30 ml 20% SDS. The sample was heated to 65 C and RNA was extracted using two rounds of acid phenol/chloroform followed by chloroform alone. RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase by adding sodium acetate to a ﬁnal concentration of 300 mM followed by at least one volume of isopropanol. Precipitation was carried out at À30 C for 30 min and RNA was then pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 3 g, 4 C. The supernatant was discarded, the pellet was airdried, and the RNA was resuspended in 150 ml Tris (pH 7). The typical RNA yield was 100 to 200 mg. Size Selection RNA was ﬁrst ﬁltered through a Microcon YM-100 (Millipore) to remove of RNAs greater than 100 nt. Subsequent experiments have shown that this ﬁltration is unnecessary and that samples can be prepared by performing electrophoretic separation directly on resuspended footprinting pellets (our unpublished observations). To perform ﬁltration, a 50 mg RNA aliquot was diluted to a total volume of 500 ml and SuperaseIn was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 U/ml. The sample was loaded onto a Microcon YM-100 (Millipore) and 50 U of SuperaseIn was placed in the collection tube. The sample was centrifuged for roughly 30 min at 510 3 g, to recover 425 ml ﬁltrate containing only small RNAs. RNA was then precipitated from the ﬁltrate as described above, except that 30 mg GlycoBlue (Ambion AM9515) was added as a coprecipitant. Filtered RNA was resuspended in 10 ml 10 mM Tris (pH 7). Samples were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in a 15% polyacrylamide gel with urea. Marker oligos oNTI199 and oNTI265 were used to demarcate the 28– 34 nt region, inclusive, that was excised. The gel slices were physically disrupted by centrifugation through a needle hole from an inner 0.5 ml microfuge tube nested in an outer 1.5 ml collection microfuge tube. The gel was extracted in 200 ml RNase-free water for 10 min at 70 C. The eluate was recovered by loading the gel slurry onto a Spin-X column (Corning 8160) and centrifuging to recover the eluate in the collection tube. RNA was then precipitated from the ﬁltered eluate as described above, including the use of a coprecipitant. mRNA-Seq Fragment Preparation A 300 ml aliquot of lysate was diluted with 300 ml 10 mM Tris (pH 7) and RNA was extracted as described above. Poly(A)+ mRNA was puriﬁed from the total RNA sample using the Oligotex mRNA Mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting mRNA was fragmented by partial hydrolysis in a bicarbonate buffer as previously described (Ingolia et al., 2009). The fragmented mRNA was separated by denaturing PAGE as described above and fragments of 50–80 nt length were selected. The fragmented mRNA was recovered from the gel as described above. Library Generation RNA samples were dephosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase, which also possesses a 30 -phosphatase activity that is capable of removing 20 ,30 -cyclic phosphodiesters. Ribosome footprints and mRNA fragments were resuspended in 25 ml 10 mM Tris (pH 8) and denatured for 2 min at 75 C. Samples were then equilibrated to 37 C and brought to a volume of 50 ml in 13 T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction buffer with 25 U T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB M0201S) and 12.5 U SuperaseIn. This dephosphorylation

reaction was incubated 1 hr at 37 C and heat-inactivated 10 min at 70 C. Dephosphorylated RNA was then puriﬁed by precipitation as described above. Linker attachment was then performed either by linker ligation or by enzymatic polyadenylation. Linker ligation was carried out in a 20 ml reaction consisting of dephosphorylated RNA, 12.5% w/v PEG 8000 (prepared from a 50% w/v stock no more than 1 month old), 10% DMSO, 1x T4 Rnl2(tr) reaction buffer, 20 U SuperaseIn, 500 ng preadenylylated miRNA cloning linker (IDT, Linker #1), and 200 U T4 Rnl2(tr) (NEB, M0242L). The ligation was incubated for 2.5 hr at 37 C. Ligation products were separated by denaturing PAGE as described above, the product bands were excised, and RNA was extracted and precipitated. Ribosome footprint samples were then treated by subtractive hybridization using biotinylated oligos that were reverse complements of abundant rRNA contaminants observed in preliminary sequencing experiments. RNA was suspended in 30 ml 23 SSC and 250 pmol total biotinylated subtraction oligos were added. The sample was denatured 2 min at 70 C, transferred to 37 C, and 20 U SuperaseIn was added. Hybridization was performed for 30 min at 37 C. Biotinylated oligos were then recovered using MyOne streptavidin C1 DynaBeads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 1 mg magnetic beads per sample. RNA was then precipitated as described above. Reverse transcription was then carried out on all samples. Reactions were prepared in a 18.0 ml volume using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 50 pmol oNTI225-Link1 primer (for linker ligation samples) or oNTI225 (for polyadenylated samples). Reactions were denatured 5 min at 65 C and then equilibrated at 48 C, at which point 10 U SuperaseIn was added along with DTT and SuperScript III enzyme. Reverse transcription was carried out for 30 min at 48 C. RNA template was destroyed by adding 2.0 ml 1N NaOH and incubating 20 min at 98 C. Reverse transcription products were then puriﬁed by denaturing PAGE, incorporating an unextended primer control to facilitate the identiﬁcation of extended products. These extended products were excised, extracted from the gel, and precipitated. Reverse transcription products were circularized by carrying out a 20 ml CircLigase (Epicenter) reaction according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using the entire extracted sample as a substrate. Some circularized ﬁrst-strand cDNA libraries were subject to a second round of subtractive hybridization as described above, except that 60 pmol total biotinylated subtraction oligos were used and no SuperaseIn was added. The subtractive oligos used with cDNA libraries were forward strand sequences derived from abundant rRNA contaminants. One quarter of the circularized cDNA was used as a template for PCR ampliﬁcation using Phusion (NEB). Reactions were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a 100 ml volume using oligos oNTI230 and oNTI231. Reactions were split into ﬁve aliquots of 16.7 ml and ampliﬁed with a 30 s denaturation at 98 C followed by cycles of 10 s denaturation at 98 C, 10 s annealing at 65 C, and 5 s extension at 72 C. Reactions were carried out for 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 cycles. Reactions were then separated by non-denaturing PAGE on an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 13 TBE. Product bands were excised from reactions selected to achieve reasonable yield without saturation, which manifests as reannealed library fragments that migrate slowly due to their imperfect complementarity. DNA was extracted as described above, except elution was carried out by soaking overnight in STE at 4 C. Extracted DNA was resuspended in 10 ml 10 mM Tris (pH 8) and veriﬁed using the High Sensitivity DNA assay on the Agilent Bioanalyzer.

Footprint Sequence Alignment Ribosome footprints were aligned as described in Ingolia (2010). The ﬁrst 26 nucleotides of each read were aligned using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) and this alignment was then extended with reference library sequence followed by library generation linker sequence CTGTAGGCACCATCAATTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGAA. The length of the reference sequence extension was chosen to minimize the number of mismatches between the read query sequence and the constructed reference-linker target sequence. The use of a 30 linker, rather than polyadenylation as described previously, avoided most ambiguity in the length of the reference sequence alignment. Alignments with up to two mismatches between the query and target sequence were accepted, and a small fraction of query sequences with over 255 alignments were suppressed. Alignments were carried out ﬁrst against a library of transcripts consisting of the mm9 UCSC Known Genes transcript sequences, downloaded on Dec 9, 2009 combined with sequences derived from the genome using the coordinates of the reconstructed transcripts in (Guttman et al., 2010). Reads with no acceptable alignment to these transcript sequences were then aligned against the mm9 genomic sequence. Footprint alignments were assigned to a speciﬁc A site nucleotide based on the length of the fragment. The offset from the 50 end of the alignment was 29–30 nt long, +15; 31–33 nt long, +16; 34–35 nt long, +17 (Figures S1A and S1B). Transcript density proﬁles were constructed by determining the number of sequencing reads whose A site was assigned to each nucleotide position. Metagene Proﬁles Footprint proﬁles within CDSes were produced by assigning reads to a codon when they mapped to nucleotides at positions À1, 0, and +1 relative to the ﬁrst nucleotide of the codon. Mean and median footprint levels were computed across CDSes, excluding the ﬁrst ﬁfteen and the last 5 codons. Nonoverlapping 5 codon windows were tiled across the body of the gene and well-translated genes were selected based on a median value of at least 2 reads per window in a cycloheximide-treated ESC sample (Table S2A). Only the representative splice isoform of each gene was considered. Metagene analyses were performed by normalizing the footprint proﬁle of each well-translated gene by the average footprint density across the body of the gene, again excluding the ﬁrst ﬁfteen and the last 5 codons. The scaled proﬁles of all well-translated genes were then averaged at each position, excluding genes from the average at positions that lay outside the bounds of their transcripts. Translation and Translational Efﬁciency Calculations The translation level of a gene was computed as the number of ribosome footprint reads mapping to the gene’s CDS, divided by the length of the CDS in nucleotides, which we call the ‘‘ribosome footprint density’’ in the gene. When comparing translation measurements between different samples (see Figures 7A, S4B, and S4B and Tables S5A and S5D), these measurements were normalized by dividing by the total number of ribosome footprint reads that align to any region of any annotated mouse transcript, which we call the ‘‘normalized ribosome footprint density.’’ This normalization accounts for differences in the total number of sequencing reads and the extent of rRNA contamination in different samples. The translational efﬁciency of a gene was computed as the ratio of the normalized ribosome footprint density to the normalized mRNA-seq read density. The latter is computed from mRNA-seq data just as normalized ribosome footprint density is computed and should reﬂect an estimate of mRNA abundance. Quantitation of translation was highly reproducible in our experiments—the comparison presented in Figure 1A represents a biological replication, convolved with any cycloheximide-induced differences in translation. When the total number of footprints involved in a comparison is small, statistical ﬂuctuations will dominate the ratio. When there are sufﬁcient footprints for reliable comparison—in the case of Figure 1A, we require 200 in total—then the ratio reﬂects underlying biological and experimental variability. The typical inter-replicate difference of 15% indicates that measurements of footprint density are highly reproducible. Gene Ontology Analysis The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test for signiﬁcant differences in the translation, translational efﬁciency, or change in translation or translational efﬁciency of genes within a certain GO category relative to the full list of genes analyzed. GO categories with at least 16 genes analyzed were tested, and the threshold for signiﬁcance was an uncorrected p < 1.7e-5, which corresponds to a Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.01. Note that the Mann-Whitney is a nonparametric, rank-based test, so the monotonic transformation between raw values and log2 values does not affect the result. The median value for genes in the GO category and for genes not in the GO category was also computed and the difference was used as a measurement of the magnitude; median values are not directly used in the Mann-Whitney test. Ribosome Pausing The restricted set of genes used for metagene analysis was selected for pausing analysis as well (Table S2A) and each footprint proﬁle was then scaled by the median footprint count on the transcript. Pauses were identiﬁed as codons whose ribosome footprint count was at least 25-fold the gene median. In order to avoid artifactually high read density caused by reads mapping to degenerate positions in the genome, pause sites were excluded when they aligned with a 28-mer hypothetical footprint, beginning 15 nt upstream of the pause site, that had a perfect match in a distinct transcript. A metagene analysis was performed on these pauses as described

above. The nucleotide and peptide sequence ﬂanking these nondegenerate pause sites was used to generate a peptide sequence motif logo. Ribosome Depletion Analysis Metagene analysis was performed on well-translated genes following harringtonine treatment using a 5 codon window average as described above. Proﬁles were then scaled by the average along the metagene proﬁle between codons 800 and 1000 inclusive. Harringtonine depletion did not extend beyond 750 codons at any time point used in this experiment, so the average read density beyond 800 codons serves as an appropriate normalization for overall sequencing coverage in a sample. The half-recovery point for each scaled proﬁle was then deﬁned as the position, beyond codon 40, where the proﬁle ﬁrst exceeded 0.5. Low- and high-expression genes were deﬁned as the lowest and highest quintile of well-translated genes sorted by mean ribosomes per codon in the CDS. Low and high TAI genes were deﬁned as the lowest and highest quartile of well-translated genes sorted by TAI. Only genes of at least 750 codons were used for stratifying genes by length; the shorter subset of genes were less than 1000 codons and the longer subset was more than 1000 codons. Secreted proteins were deﬁned based on SignalP predictions in the Ensembl database. Initiation Site Prediction Initiation site score vectors were constructed from footprint proﬁles in four harringtonine-treated samples: the 90S, 120S, and 150S proﬁles described above, plus a fourth proﬁle from a sample treated with 0.5 mg/ml harringtonine for 180S in a preliminary experiment. An initiation site scoring vector was constructed for a nucleotide position by ﬁrst collecting a per-codon footprint proﬁle from the pernucleotide footprint proﬁle by summing reads at nucleotide positions at À1, +0, and +1 relative to the ﬁrst nucleotide of a codon. Codons at the following positions, relative to the candidate initiation codon at position 0, were then summed as follows: [[À2, À1], [0], [1], [2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13]]. This provided eight read counts per sample, which were concatenated to produce a 32-element initiation site proﬁle vector. With the initiation codon deﬁned as position 0, the A site position showing the strongest footprint accumulation was position +1. The training set was constructed using the ﬁrst and second of every three genes in the set of well-translated genes (Table S1). The nucleotide position of the annotated start codon was used as a positive example and the following nucleotide positions, relative to the start codon, were used as negative examples: [À6, À3, 3, 9, 18, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150]. Positions without at least 18 nucleotides on each side of the initiation site scoring window, which covers nucleotides À7 through +40 relative to the candidate initiation site, were excluded. The vectors were used to train the ‘‘svm_learn’’ program within ‘‘svm_light’’ using a radial basis kernel, g = 2.4, error/margin trade-off C = 2.0, relative positive example weighting of 4.0 (though there were 10-fold more negative than positive examples in the training corpus), using iterative removal and retraining. The model was then tested on the third of every three genes in the set of well-translated genes (Table S2A), using the same positive and negative nucleotide positions. Initiation sites were predicted based on a minimum score of 0.75 and at least 50 harringtonine footprint reads overall in the scoring vector (covering 48 nucleotides per proﬁle across four proﬁles). Contiguous blocks of initiation site nucleotide positions were collected into a single initiation site, whose width is given in the ‘‘Harr Peak Width’’ column of Table S3. The site was then assigned to an initiation codon whose ﬁrst nucleotide was located within the site. If an AUG codon was present, then the initiation site was assigned to it. If no AUG was present but a near-cognate codon was present, then the site was assigned to it. Sites with no candidate initiation codon were excluded from further analysis because it was not typically possible to predict the reading frame being decoded. Alternative Isoform Analysis In order to identify initiation sites affected by alternative splicing, UCSC genomic coordinates and cluster IDs were used to determine whether each initiation site was present in all splice isoforms of a gene, or only found in a subset of isoforms. We identiﬁed 1827 initiation sites that were absent in some splice isoforms and either annotated as a uORF in all isoforms containing the site, or as an overlapping uORF in all isoforms containing the site. To identify differences in 50 UTR translation of distinct isoforms, ribosome footprint and mRNA-seq reads were mapped to the transcripts and classiﬁed as alternative or constitutive by the following method. We ﬁrst created an index of isoform-speciﬁc sequence positions in the transcriptome by mapping each 28 nt window of each UCSC transcript with Bowtie against all other transcripts; matches to other transcripts of the same gene indicated that a window was shared by multiple isoforms of the gene. Twenty-eight nucleotide windows that matched multiple genomic positions, e.g., repetitive sequences, were discarded. The result was an annotation of each transcript position as isoform-speciﬁc or shared by multiple isoforms of the same gene. We also classiﬁed each position as 50 UTR, CDS, or 30 UTR in each isoform. Most positions were shared between multiple isoforms, leaving only a fraction of positions that could distinguish between isoforms. (The motivation of this indexing method was to count the total number of isoform-speciﬁc positions, not just those observed in sparse ribosome footprint data, to allow calculations of footprint density, i.e., footprints per base.) We then took the Bowtie alignments of all ribosome footprint and mRNA-seq reads to the transcriptome and tallied the number of reads falling in each category: isoform A 50 UTR, isoform A CDS + isoform B CDS, etc. The 906 genes with alternative uORF initiation sites and sufﬁcient isoform-speciﬁc sequence (at least 21 isoform-speciﬁc 50 UTR windows for at least two isoforms of the gene) were analyzed for differences in translation. A c2 test was used to test each gene for

signiﬁcant differences between ribosome and mRNA-seq read counts across each isoform-speciﬁc 50 UTR region. That is, we constructed a contingency table with the number of footprint (ribosome) reads and mRNA sequence reads speciﬁc to each 50 UTR isoform. Two hundred and sixty-three genes had a signiﬁcant difference in ribosome footprint to mRNA ratios between isoforms, with a false discovery rate of 1%. (c2 results for genes with expected counts of 5 or less in any cell of the contingency table were discarded as not having enough data for a reliable comparison. This undercounts the biologically interesting examples by discarding genes with two highly expressed, differentially translated 50 UTR isoforms and a third isoform that is never observed in this cell type.) lincRNA Analysis Proﬁles of ribosome footprints on lincRNAs were computed using only alignments with a unique genomic origin in order to exclude the misassignment of reads that actually derived from a known protein-coding transcript. The genomic origin was deﬁned by determining the genomic coordinate corresponding to the position of each transcript alignment. The 90 nt window with the most nucleotide positions occupied by ribosome footprints was identiﬁed for each lincRNA proﬁle, and the ribosome footprint and mRNA-Seq read density was determined for this window. The translational efﬁciency of the window was deﬁned as the ratio of ribosome footprint read density to mRNA-Seq read density. As a comparison, the same analysis was performed for windows contained entirely within the codon sequence of the set of well-translated protein-coding genes, and similarly for the 30 UTRs of these genes.
